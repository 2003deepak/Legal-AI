    "Smt. Roshni was married to Bhagirath (Respondent No. 1) about 1.5 years prior to her death.",

    "On 10.06.1991, Smt. Roshni died due to burn injuries sustained at her matrimonial home.",
    "The prosecution alleged that Roshni was subjected to harassment and cruelty by the respondents in connection with demands for dowry, specifically a scooter.",
    "PW-4 (Ram Niwas, father of the deceased) testified that Roshni had complained about the dowry demands and harassment approximately 10-15 days before her death when she visited her parental home.",
    "PW-4 also stated that he had tried to convene a panchayat to resolve the issue, but the accused party did not attend.",
    "PW-5 (Dharam Pal, a relative) corroborated the claims of dowry demands.",
    "The Trial Court acquitted all the accused, finding the evidence regarding dowry demands and cruelty unreliable.",

    "The High Court upheld the acquittal under Section 302 IPC.",
