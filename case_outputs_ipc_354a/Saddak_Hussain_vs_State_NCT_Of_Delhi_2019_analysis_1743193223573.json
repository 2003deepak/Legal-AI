  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Appeal Partly Allowed. Conviction modified from Sections 392/397 IPC to Section 394 IPC. Sentence reduced.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The High Court found the complainant's (PW-1) testimony regarding the robbery and being attacked credible and consistent, including the identification of the appellant.",
      "The MLC proved that 'simple' injury was caused by a 'sharp object' during the robbery, clearly establishing the ingredients of Section 394 IPC (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery).",
      "However, for Section 397 IPC, the Court emphasized the requirement of proving the 'use' of a 'deadly weapon'.",
      "The alleged weapon ('Sua'/Ice Pick) was not recovered. While recovery is not always essential, its absence makes it difficult to ascertain if the weapon was indeed 'deadly' as contemplated by S. 397.",
      "Relying on precedents like Phool Kumar and Ashfaq, the court noted that 'use' implies employing the weapon offensively or to create terror. Merely causing a simple injury with a sharp object, without recovery or further evidence of its deadly nature or menacing use, was deemed insufficient to meet the higher threshold of Section 397.",
      "The court differentiated between causing hurt (S. 394) and using a deadly weapon (S. 397). Since the 'deadly' nature and specific 'use' under S. 397 couldn't be proven beyond reasonable doubt due to non-recovery, the conviction under S. 397 was set aside.",
      "The conviction was maintained under Section 392 IPC (as robbery was proven) read with Section 394 IPC (as simple hurt was proven to be caused during the robbery).",
      "Consequently, the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years under S. 397 was no longer applicable, and the sentence was reduced based on the period already undergone or a lesser term deemed appropriate for S. 394 IPC."
