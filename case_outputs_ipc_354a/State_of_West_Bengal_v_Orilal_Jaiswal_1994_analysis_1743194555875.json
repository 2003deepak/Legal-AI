    "Evidence primarily consisted of testimony from the deceased's father (PW1) and brother (PW2) detailing the alleged dowry demands and harassment reported to them by the deceased.",
    "Letters allegedly written by the deceased mentioning unhappiness and ill-treatment were also part of the evidence, though their specific contents linking directly to suicidal intent were debated.",

  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Acquittal. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the judgment of the High Court and the Trial Court, thereby acquitting the respondents.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Court emphasized that conviction under Section 306 IPC is not sustainable merely on the allegation of harassment without positive action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused, which led or compelled the person to commit suicide.",
      "To constitute 'instigation', there must be direct or indirect incitement to the commission of the crime. Mere existence of harassment or cruelty, while potentially grounds for prosecution under other sections (like 498A), does not automatically translate to abetment of suicide.",
      "The Court found that the prosecution failed to establish the requisite *mens rea* – an intention on the part of the accused to aid or instigate or abet the deceased to commit suicide.",
      "The evidence presented, mainly general allegations of dowry demands and ill-treatment, did not demonstrate any specific act of instigation or aiding by the accused that left the deceased with no option but to end her life.",
      "The standard of proof required for Section 306 is high and must be established beyond reasonable doubt, focusing on the specific elements of abetment defined in Section 107 IPC.",
      "The Court differentiated this case from instances where direct acts of incitement were proven, holding that the evidence here fell short of the legal requirements for abetment of suicide."
