  "facts": [
    "Madhukar Narayan Mardikar (Respondent) was serving as a Police Inspector in Amravati District, Maharashtra.",
    "A complaint was lodged against him by a woman named Banubi Sardar Khan.",
    "The core allegation by Banubi was that the respondent went to her hut around midnight on November 12/13, 1965, woke her up, and attempted to molest or rape her ('bad intention'). She claimed she raised an alarm, causing him to flee.",
    "A departmental inquiry was initiated against the respondent for misconduct based on this complaint.",
    "The Inquiry Officer found the respondent guilty of misconduct, specifically concluding that he visited Banubi's hut with 'bad intention' and misbehaved with her.",
    "Based on the inquiry report, the Deputy Inspector General of Police passed an order dismissing the respondent from service.",
    "The respondent challenged the dismissal order by filing a writ petition before the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench).",
    "The High Court allowed the writ petition and quashed the dismissal order.",
    "The High Court's reasoning significantly focused on the character of the complainant, Banubi, describing her as being of 'easy virtue' or 'doubtful character' and concluded her testimony was unreliable and insufficient to establish the charge against the respondent.",
    "The State of Maharashtra appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court."
