  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Appeal allowed. High Court judgment set aside. Trial Court judgment convicting A1 (Ravi) under Section 302 IPC restored.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Supreme Court found the High Court's reasons for discarding PW1's testimony to be flimsy and unsustainable.",
      "PW1 was a natural witness (son sleeping outside). His presence was probable.",
      "Identification in chimney light was possible at close range; PW1's testimony was consistent and corroborated by prompt lodging of complaint (Ex. P-1) which formed the basis of FIR.",
      "Delay in lodging FIR was adequately explained (incident at night, went to VAO in the morning).",
      "Relationship and enmity do not automatically discredit a witness; PW1's testimony was found credible after careful scrutiny.",
      "The recovery of M.O.1 (billhook) under Section 27, Evidence Act, was found reliable. Minor discrepancies in PW7's testimony were not fatal.",
      "The fact that M.O.1 was found stained with human blood, though group couldn't be determined, was a valid corroborating circumstance, especially when considered with PW1's direct evidence.",
      "Medical evidence (PW9, Ex. P-4) fully corroborated the manner of assault and weapon described by PW1.",
      "The High Court had improperly interfered with the Trial Court's well-reasoned judgment of conviction by taking a perverse view of the evidence.",
      "The chain of evidence, including eyewitness account, motive, recovery, and medical evidence, was complete and pointed towards the guilt of A1."
