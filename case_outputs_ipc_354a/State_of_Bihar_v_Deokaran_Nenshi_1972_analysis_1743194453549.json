  "facts": [
    "The respondents, Deokaran Nenshi (owner) and P.B.rapati (manager) of the Stone Lime Company's Murli Hill Quarry, were required under Regulation 3 of the Indian Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1926 (read with Section 66 of the Mines Act, 1952) to furnish annual returns for the year ending December 31, 1959.",
    "The prescribed deadline for submitting these returns was January 21, 1960.",
    "The respondents failed to furnish the annual returns by the due date.",
    "A complaint was filed against the respondents by the Chief Inspector of Mines, Dhanbad, before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Sasaram, on April 12, 1961.",
    "The complaint alleged an offence under Section 66 of the Mines Act, 1952, punishable under Section 79 of the said Act.",
    "The respondents argued before the Magistrate that the prosecution was barred by limitation under Section 79 of the Mines Act, 1952, as the complaint was filed more than six months after the date of the alleged offence (January 21, 1960).",
    "The Magistrate upheld the objection and dismissed the complaint as time-barred.",
    "The State of Bihar filed an appeal against the Magistrate's order to the Patna High Court.",
    "The High Court agreed with the Magistrate, holding that the failure to furnish the return by the due date constituted a completed offence on January 21, 1960, and was not a continuing offence. Therefore, the prosecution was barred by limitation.",
    "The State of Bihar appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court of India."

  "prosecution_arguments": [

      "argument": "The failure to furnish annual returns as required by the Mines Act and Regulations constitutes a 'continuing offence'. The offence persists for every day the default continues after the due date (January 21, 1960).",

        "Conceptually similar arguments often rely on interpretations where the law imposes a continuous duty.

  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Appeal dismissed. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, confirming that the failure to file the annual return was not a continuing offence and the prosecution was barred by limitation.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Court distinguished between an offence that arises 'once and for all' and a 'continuing offence'.",
      "A continuing offence requires a 'continuing source of injury' and typically involves an act or omission that persists over time (e.g., unlawful possession, carrying on an activity without a license).",
      "Failure to comply with a statutory requirement *by a specific date* constitutes an offence completed on that date or the day after.",
      "The obligation under Regulation 3 read with Section 66 was to furnish the return by January 21, 1960. The failure occurred on that date.",
      "The language of the Act and Regulations did not suggest that the non-filing constituted a fresh offence for each day of default. If the legislature intended it to be a continuing offence, it would typically specify a daily fine for continued non-compliance.",
      "Therefore, the offence was completed on January 21, 1960. The limitation period under Section 79 of the Mines Act began to run from that date.",
      "The complaint filed on April 12, 1961, was clearly beyond the six-month limitation period.",
      "The Court explicitly approved the reasoning in *State v. Laxminarayan Nathuram Purohit* (AIR 1958 MP 350) and *Public Prosecutor v. K. Sesha Shayee* (AIR 1960 Mad 231)."
