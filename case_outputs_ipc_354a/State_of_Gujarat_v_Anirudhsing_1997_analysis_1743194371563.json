      "The ingredient of 'voluntarily causing hurt' to a 'public servant' (ASI Rana) 'while discharging his duty' or 'to deter him from discharging his duty' under Section 332 IPC was established. The incident occurred at the police station while Rana was supposed to be on duty.",
      "However, the essential element of 'dishonest intention' required for 'theft' under Section 378 IPC (and thus for 'robbery' under Section 390/392 IPC) was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.",
      "The Court reasoned that the accused PSI, being a superior officer, might have taken the Station Diary (movable property) high-handedly or to make a record against the ASI for alleged dereliction of duty, rather than with the intention of causing wrongful gain to himself or wrongful loss to the police department. The possibility of the taking being under a claim of authority, however improper, created doubt regarding 'dishonest intention'.",
