  "facts": [
    "The respondent, Major Singh, was accused of committing an offense under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code.",
    "The victim was a female child aged 7 and a half months.",
    "The incident occurred on March 13, 1962, around 6:00 PM in the village of Ludhiana district.",
    "The child's mother found her crying and bleeding from her private parts shortly after the respondent had taken the child out of the house.",
    "Medical examination conducted by Dr. Harpal Kaur revealed multiple injuries inside the vagina, including tears in the hymen and posterior fourchette, indicating forceful penetration by a hard object, possibly a human finger or male organ.",
    "The doctor opined that the injuries constituted an 'attempt to rape'.",
    "The respondent was initially charged under Section 376 (Rape) read with Section 511 (Attempt) IPC, but the Sessions Judge altered the charge to Section 354 IPC (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty).",
    "The Sessions Judge convicted the respondent under Section 354 IPC and sentenced him to two years' rigorous imprisonment.",
    "On appeal, the High Court of Punjab acquitted the respondent, holding that a female infant of 7.5 months could not possess a sense of 'modesty' and therefore, her modesty could not be outraged.",
    "The State of Punjab appealed the High Court's acquittal to the Supreme Court.",
    "The key legal question before the Supreme Court was whether a female child of such a tender age could be considered to have 'modesty' capable of being outraged under Section 354 IPC."

    "outcome": "Appeal allowed (State's appeal succeeded). The Supreme Court (by majority) set aside the High Court's acquittal and restored the conviction and sentence passed by the Sessions Judge under Section 354 IPC.",
    "reasoning": [
      "Majority View (Sarkar, Mudholkar JJ.):",
      "- 'Woman' under Section 10 IPC includes females of all ages.",
      "- 'Modesty' is an attribute of the female sex, inherent from birth. It is not contingent on the victim's age or her subjective understanding or awareness of it.",
      "- The term 'outrage' relates to the CULPRIT'S action, judged objectively. If the act committed is inherently indecent and is done with the intention or knowledge that it would offend the modesty of a woman (in the objective sense), the offense is complete.",
      "- The essence of a woman's modesty is her sex. An act involving forceful penetration into the private parts of a female child, regardless of her age, is intrinsically an affront to her womanhood and thus an outrage to her modesty.",
      "Minority View (Bachawat J.):",
      "- 'Modesty' implies a sense of propriety, decency, and shame, which develops with age and understanding. An infant lacks this sense.",
      "- An act cannot 'outrage' something that does not exist or is not perceived by the victim.",
      "- While the act committed was punishable under other sections (like causing hurt), it did not fulfill the specific requirements of Section 354 as the element of 'outraging modesty' (in the subjective sense understood by the minority) was absent."
