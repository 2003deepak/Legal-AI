  "facts": [
    "The petitioner, Sushil Kumar Sharma, filed a Writ Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.",
    "The petition challenged the constitutional validity of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860.",
    "The primary contention was that Section 498A was being widely misused by disgruntled wives and their families to harass husbands and their relatives.",
    "It was argued that the provision led to automatic arrests, violated fundamental rights, and was used as a tool for extortion and 'legal terrorism'.",
    "The petitioner argued that the vague language of Section 498A, particularly the definition of 'cruelty', allowed for arbitrary application.",
    "The petitioner contended that the section violated Articles 14 (Equality before law), 19 (Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, etc.), and 21 (Protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.",
    "The Union of India, as the primary respondent, defended the constitutionality of the section, highlighting its objective to protect women from marital cruelty and dowry-related harassment.",
    "The Supreme Court considered the legislative intent, the scope of the provision, arguments regarding its misuse, and its constitutional validity."

      "The Court held that the term 'cruelty' as defined in the Explanation to Section 498A is comprehensive and provides sufficient legislative guidance, thus the provision is not unconstitutionally vague.",
      "It emphasized that safeguards against arbitrary arrest and misuse are present within the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and through judicial oversight (e.g., Section 482 CrPC, writ jurisdiction).",
      "The Court observed that the legislature is the best judge of the needs of the people and the choice of methods to address social evils. The classification made under Section 498A (protecting married women from specific types of cruelty) was found to be reasonable and non-violative of Article 14.",
      "While acknowledging concerns about misuse, the Court stressed that the remedy lies in ensuring stricter implementation of existing safeguards by police and courts, not in striking down the law itself.",
      "Directions were issued to the law enforcement agencies and lower courts to exercise caution, conduct preliminary verification, and avoid mechanical arrests, ensuring that the provision is not used as a tool for harassment but serves its intended purpose. (This directive aspect is a significant part of the judgment's impact).",
      "The Court concluded that Section 498A does not violate Articles 14, 19, or 21 of the Constitution."
