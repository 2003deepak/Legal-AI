  "facts": [
    "There was a faction feud in village Vemulapalli, Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh.",
    "On March 14, 1968, around 8:00 AM, a meeting of village elders (Panchayat) was held at the house of Mantri Veerabhadrayya (PW 4) to settle disputes between the faction led by accused A-1 (Rayavarapu Punnayya) and the deceased Jagannadham.",
    "The Panchayat failed to reach a resolution.",
    "Immediately after the Panchayat dispersal, while the deceased was near the house of PW 4, A-1 questioned him.",
    "An altercation ensued between A-1 and the deceased.",
    "Accused A-1 inflicted a single blow with a spear (described as 'barchi' or 'palaka barchi') on the chest/abdomen region of the deceased.",
    "Accused A-2 (Rayavarapu Jagannadham, son of A-1) allegedly hit the deceased on the head with a stick.",
    "The deceased collapsed and died shortly after in a nearby lane.",
    "Medical evidence (post-mortem report by Dr. T. Ramamohana Rao, PW 1) indicated one penetrating wound (1\"x1/2\") on the left side of the abdomen, damaging the stomach and spleen, leading to hemorrhage and shock.",
    "The injury was described by the doctor as necessarily fatal and sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",
    "The Trial Court (Sessions Judge, Guntur) convicted A-1 under Section 302 IPC and sentenced him to life imprisonment. A-2 was convicted under Section 324 IPC and sentenced to 6 months RI.",
    "On appeal, the High Court of Andhra Pradesh acquitted A-2 entirely.",
    "The High Court altered A-1's conviction from Section 302 IPC to Section 326 IPC (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons) and reduced the sentence to 5 years RI.",
    "The State of Andhra Pradesh appealed the High Court's decision regarding A-1 to the Supreme Court.",
    "The primary issue before the Supreme Court was whether A-1's act constituted murder (Section 302 IPC) or culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304 Part I or II IPC) or grievous hurt (Section 326 IPC)."

  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Conviction altered from Section 326 IPC (by High Court) to Section 304 Part II IPC (by Supreme Court). The sentence imposed by the Supreme Court was 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Supreme Court elaborately discussed the distinction between Section 299 and Section 300 IPC.",
      "It reaffirmed the principles laid down in Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab for Section 300 Clause Thirdly.",
      "The Court found that A-1 clearly intended to cause bodily injury with the spear (satisfying the first part of Clause Thirdly). The nature of the weapon and the target area (abdomen) supported this finding.",
      "Medical evidence established that the injury inflicted was objectively sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death (satisfying the second part of Clause Thirdly).",
      "However, the Court distinguished between 'intention' and 'knowledge'. While the act objectively fell under Section 300 Clause Thirdly based on Virsa Singh, the Court seemed to lean towards classifying the mens rea as 'knowledge' rather than the specific 'intention' required for murder in the circumstances (perhaps influenced by the sudden quarrel context, though Exception 4 was not explicitly applied).",
      "The court held that the accused had knowledge that thrusting a spear into the abdomen was likely to cause an injury likely to cause death. This fits Section 299(c) ('knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death').",
      "Therefore, the offence was culpable homicide not amounting to murder, falling under Section 304 Part II (punishment for culpable homicide committed with knowledge), rather than murder (Section 302) or grievous hurt (Section 326).",
      "The High Court's reduction to Section 326 was deemed erroneous as it overlooked the fatal nature of the intended injury and the associated knowledge.",
      "The Trial Court's conviction under Section 302 was also set aside, implying the Court did not find the specific 'intention' element of Section 300 Clause Thirdly fully satisfied in the subjective sense, despite the objective sufficiency of the injury."
