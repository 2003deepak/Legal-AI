  "facts": [
    "Marriage between Arnesh Kumar (Appellant) and Sweta Kiran (Respondent No. 2) solemnized on July 1, 2007.",
    "Sweta Kiran alleged demands for dowry (Rs. 8 Lakhs, a Maruti car, an air-conditioner, a television set etc.) by Arnesh Kumar and his family.",
    "Sweta Kiran alleged she was driven out of the matrimonial home due to non-fulfillment of these dowry demands.",
    "Sweta Kiran lodged FIR No. 197/2012, dated 'Insufficient data' (prior to High Court petition), at P.S. Mahila Thana, Patna.",
    "FIR registered under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.",
    "Arnesh Kumar apprehended arrest based on the FIR.",
    "Appellant Arnesh Kumar sought Anticipatory Bail before the Sessions Judge, Patna, which was rejected.",
    "Appellant filed an application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. before the High Court of Patna seeking quashing of the FIR, which was also dismissed on October 24, 2013.",
    "Appellant appealed the High Court's decision before the Supreme Court of India, primarily seeking protection against arrest.",
    "Supreme Court noted statistical data indicating a high number of arrests under Section 498A IPC, often including relatives, with a low conviction rate.",
    "Supreme Court observed that arrest brings humiliation, curtails freedom, and casts scars forever, and should not be a routine procedure.",
    "The core issue addressed by the Supreme Court was the procedure for arrest by police, especially concerning offences punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be less than seven years or which may extend to seven years; whether with or without fine, in light of Section 41 and 41A of the Cr.P.C."
