  "facts": [
    "Appeal filed by Vikram Johar against the final judgment and order dated 29.01.2018 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad.",
    "The High Court allowed the Government Appeal filed by the State of Uttar Pradesh against the judgment dated 15.03.2013 of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghaziabad.",
    "The Trial Court (ACJM, Ghaziabad) had acquitted the appellant (Vikram Johar) and one co-accused (since deceased) of offences punishable under Sections 452, 323, 504, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.",
    "The High Court, reversing the acquittal, convicted the appellant under Sections 452, 323, 504, and 506 IPC and sentenced him accordingly (details of sentence not specified in the core analysis section of the SC judgment but implied conviction).",
    "The FIR (No. 1333/2009) was lodged on 03.08.2009 at PS Indrapuram, Ghaziabad by Respondent No. 2 (Smt. Madhu Garg).",
    "Allegations in FIR: On 03.08.2009 at around 1:00 PM, the appellant and co-accused (Sudhir Kumar Garg, deceased) forcibly entered the house of the complainant (Respondent No. 2), hurled abuses related to a property dispute, threatened to kill her and her husband, and physically assaulted them.",
    "Investigation followed, charge sheet filed against the appellant and co-accused.",
    "Prosecution examined three witnesses: PW-1 (Smt. Madhu Garg - complainant), PW-2 (Shri Sunil Kumar Garg - husband), and PW-3 (Dr. Akhilesh Kumar - medical officer).",
    "Defense examined one witness (DW-1) and relied on documentary evidence.",
    "Trial Court acquitted based on: Material contradictions in testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2, lack of independent witness support despite the incident occurring in a populated area during daytime, delay in medical examination, and finding the prosecution case not proved beyond reasonable doubt.",
    "High Court, in the Government Appeal, re-appreciated the evidence and concluded that the Trial Court's view was erroneous and based on flimsy grounds, leading to the reversal of acquittal and conviction of the appellant."
