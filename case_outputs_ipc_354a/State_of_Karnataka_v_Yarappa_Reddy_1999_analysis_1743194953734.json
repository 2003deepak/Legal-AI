  "facts": [
    "The respondent, Yarappa Reddy, was accused of murdering Venkatamma, the wife of his elder brother PW-3 (Venkataswamy Reddy).",
    "The incident occurred during the night between 10-11-1986 and 11-11-1986 in their village (Chikkaballapur Taluk, Kolar District, Karnataka).",
    "Motive alleged by prosecution: Disputes over the partition of joint family property, for which PW-3 had filed a civil suit against the respondent and others.",
    "The deceased was sleeping on a cot outside her house with her children.",
    "PW-4 (Lakshmidevamma), the 10-year-old daughter of the deceased, was sleeping nearby and was presented as an eyewitness.",
    "PW-4 testified that she woke up hearing her mother's cries ('Ayyo') and saw the respondent hitting her mother on the head with a stone (MO-1). She claimed she identified him in the moonlight and then ran inside the house crying.",
    "PW-3 (husband) testified that he was sleeping inside, woke up on hearing PW-4's cries, came out, and saw the respondent running away from near the scene towards his own house.",
    "PW-3 lodged the First Information Report (FIR).",
    "PW-1 (Dr. Nanja Reddy) conducted the post-mortem examination. He found a lacerated wound on the left side of the head and a fracture of the underlying skull bone. Cause of death was shock and hemorrhage due to head injury.",
    "PW-1 opined the injury could be caused by the stone MO-1.",
    "MO-1 (a blood-stained stone) was allegedly recovered from an open field near the respondent's house based on a disclosure statement made by the respondent while in police custody (Section 27, Evidence Act). PW-6 was a mahazar witness to the recovery.",
    "The Sessions Court convicted the respondent under Section 302 IPC, relying primarily on the testimonies of PW-3 and PW-4, supported by medical evidence, recovery, and motive.",
    "The High Court of Karnataka, on appeal by the respondent, set aside the conviction and acquitted him.",
    "The High Court disbelieved PW-4 (child witness) citing delay in recording her statement (only after inquest), possibility of tutoring, and improbability of identification in the dark.",
    "The High Court found PW-3's testimony unreliable due to inconsistencies and his status as an interested witness, noting he didn't initially name the accused to the doctor (PW-1).",
    "The High Court doubted the recovery of MO-1 under Section 27, as it was recovered from an open place accessible to all.",
    "The High Court found the motive evidence weak.",
    "The State of Karnataka appealed the High Court's acquittal to the Supreme Court."

His failure to name the accused immediately, particularly to the doctor (PW-1) soon after the incident, was deemed a significant omission casting doubt on his claim of seeing the accused run away.",
      "The Court concurred with the High Court that the recovery of MO-1 (stone) from an open place accessible to all significantly weakened its evidentiary value under Section 27 of the Evidence Act.",
      "Motive (property dispute) alone was insufficient to sustain conviction when the primary evidence (eyewitness testimony and recovery) was unreliable.",
      "The Supreme Court concluded that the view taken by the High Court in acquitting the respondent was a possible and plausible view based on the evidence on record, and therefore, no interference was warranted.",
