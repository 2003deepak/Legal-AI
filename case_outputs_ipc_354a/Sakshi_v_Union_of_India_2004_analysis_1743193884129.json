  "facts": [
    "The petition was filed as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by Sakshi, an NGO working on child rights and against child sexual abuse.",
    "The petition challenged the constitutional validity and adequacy of Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, defining 'rape', particularly concerning its application to child victims.",
    "Petitioners argued that the definition of rape under Section 375, primarily focusing on penile-vaginal penetration, was excessively narrow and failed to encompass various forms of sexual assault commonly perpetrated against children (e.g., oral sex, digital penetration, object insertion).",
    "They contended that this narrow definition left many child victims without adequate legal protection and remedy, violating their fundamental rights under the Constitution of India.",
    "The petition highlighted the recommendations of the Law Commission of India (specifically the 172nd Report) which suggested amendments to broaden the definition of sexual assault.",
    "Reference was made to international instruments, particularly the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), 1989, ratified by India in 1992, which obligates the state to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse.",
    "The petitioners sought directions from the Supreme Court to either interpret Section 375 expansively or direct the Parliament to enact comprehensive legislation addressing child sexual abuse.",
    "The Union of India was the primary respondent, representing the State.",
    "Judgment was delivered by the Supreme Court of India on March 26, 2004."

  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "The Supreme Court acknowledged the lacunae in Section 375 IPC concerning child sexual abuse and agreed with the petitioners that the existing definition was inadequate. However, the Court refrained from redefining 'rape' through judicial interpretation, holding that amending the penal code falls within the exclusive domain of the Legislature. The Court strongly recommended that Parliament address the issue expeditiously by enacting suitable legislation consistent with the Law Commission's recommendations and India's obligations under the UN CRC.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Court recognized the fundamental rights of children, including the right to protection from sexual abuse, under Article 21.",
      "It acknowledged the validity of the petitioners' concerns regarding the narrowness of Section 375 and its failure to cover many forms of child sexual assault.",
      "The Court heavily emphasized the doctrine of separation of powers, stating that the judiciary cannot usurp the legislative function of defining crimes or amending the penal code.",
      "While acknowledging the power under Article 142 for doing complete justice, the Court deemed it inappropriate to use this power to effectively legislate a new definition of a criminal offence.",
      "The Court took note of the Law Commission's recommendations and India's commitments under the UN CRC, using these to underscore the urgency and necessity for legislative action.",
      "The judgment served as a strong nudge to Parliament, highlighting the constitutional and international obligations to protect children, effectively paving the way for future legislation (which culminated in the POCSO Act, 2012)."
