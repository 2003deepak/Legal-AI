  "facts": [
    "Incident Date: September 9, 1989, around 4/5 PM.",
    "Location: Fields near village Gill Kalan.",
    "Victim (Prosecutrix - PW2): A minor girl, below 16 years of age.",
    "Accused: Gurmit Singh.",
    "Allegation: While the prosecutrix was grazing cattle, the accused allegedly caught hold of her, dragged her to a nearby field (vari field), and committed rape.",
    "Reporting: The prosecutrix narrated the incident to her mother (PW3) upon returning home. The father (PW4) was informed later.",
    "FIR Lodged: September 10, 1989 (next day) by the father (PW4).",
    "Medical Examination (PW1 - Doctor): Conducted on September 10, 1989. Findings included a torn hymen, suggestive of sexual intercourse. No spermatozoa detected. No significant external injuries noted on the prosecutrix or the accused.",
    "Trial Court Verdict: Convicted Gurmit Singh under Section 376 IPC and sentenced him to 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) plus a fine.",
    "High Court Verdict: Upheld the conviction under Section 376 IPC but reduced the sentence to 5 years RI.",
    "Supreme Court Appeal: Filed by the State of Punjab challenging the High Court's reduction of the sentence.",
    "Judicial Observation (Supreme Court): Noted the 'timid' and 'hesitant' nature of the prosecutrix's testimony but attributed it to her age and the trauma experienced.",
    "Judicial Observation (Supreme Court): Emphasized that delay in lodging FIR in sexual assault cases is understandable due to factors like social stigma, family consultation, and victim trauma.",
    "Judicial Observation (Supreme Court): Stated that medical evidence (like absence of injuries or spermatozoa) is corroborative and its absence doesn't necessarily discredit the prosecutrix's testimony if it's otherwise reliable."
