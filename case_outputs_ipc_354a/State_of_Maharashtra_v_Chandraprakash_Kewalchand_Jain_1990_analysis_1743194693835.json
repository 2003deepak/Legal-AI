  "facts": [
    "Marriage between the respondent (Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain) and Manjula took place in February 1985.",
    "Manjula died due to 95% burn injuries on July 22, 1985, at the Main Hospital, Akola, Maharashtra, within about six months of marriage.",
    "The incident occurred at the matrimonial home in Akola.",
    "The prosecution alleged that Manjula was subjected to cruelty and harassment by the respondent (husband) and his relatives in connection with demands for dowry (Rs. 50,000, a scooter, refrigerator, television).",
    "Evidence included letters written by the deceased (Exhibits 30, 31, 32) to her parents, expressing her unhappiness and mentioning troubles caused by her husband and in-laws, indirectly linking to demands.",
    "Testimony of the deceased's father (PW1), mother (PW2), and brother (PW3) supported the allegations of dowry demands and harassment.",
    "The defense claimed it was a case of suicide, not related to dowry demands or cruelty.",
    "The Trial Court (Sessions Judge, Akola) acquitted the respondent of charges under Section 306 (Abetment of Suicide) and Section 498A (Cruelty) IPC, finding the letters vague and parental testimony unreliable/insufficiently proximate.",
    "The High Court (Bombay High Court, Nagpur Bench) reversed the acquittal for Section 498A IPC, convicting the respondent and sentencing him to 2 years Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000. The High Court upheld the acquittal under Section 306 IPC, finding insufficient evidence for abetment.",
    "The State of Maharashtra appealed to the Supreme Court against the acquittal under Section 306 IPC.",
    "The respondent (accused) filed a cross-appeal against his conviction under Section 498A IPC."

      "The evidence, particularly the letters (Exh. 30-32) corroborated by parental testimony (PW1, PW2, PW3), was sufficient to establish cruelty under Section 498A IPC (harassment linked to dowry demands). The High Court's assessment of this evidence was deemed reasonable.",

      "Section 306 requires proof of instigation, conspiracy, or intentional aiding, which involves a higher degree of culpability and direct nexus to the act of suicide. The evidence did not establish such direct abetment.",
      "The Court highlighted the distinction between Section 498A and Section 306 IPC. Conduct constituting 'cruelty' might not necessarily amount to 'abetment'.",
      "The Court discussed the presumptions under Section 113A (Abetment of Suicide - discretionary) and Section 113B (Dowry Death - mandatory) of the Indian Evidence Act. It noted that the High Court correctly found the evidence insufficient to draw the discretionary presumption under Section 113A for a Section 306 conviction, even though cruelty (S.498A) was established.",
      "The Court affirmed that the purpose of Section 498A was to address cruelty causing mental agony, including harassment for dowry, and the evidence met this standard."
