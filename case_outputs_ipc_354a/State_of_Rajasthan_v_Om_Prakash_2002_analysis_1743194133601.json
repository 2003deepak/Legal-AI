  "facts": [
    "Marriage between Om Prakash (Respondent No. 1/Accused) and Kamlesh (deceased) solemnized on 25.04.1988.",
    "Kamlesh died due to burn injuries at her matrimonial home in Village Mandawara, District Nagaur, Rajasthan on 08.09.1988.",
    "The death occurred within approximately 4.5 months of the marriage.",
    "Initial report (Ex. P-3) lodged by Om Prakash suggested accidental death due to stove bursting while preparing tea.",
    "Bhanwar Lal (PW-2, father of the deceased) lodged a First Information Report (FIR) (Ex. P-1) on 09.09.1988 alleging that his daughter was harassed for dowry (demand for TV and Fridge) and killed by her husband and in-laws.",
    "Prosecution witnesses, including PW-2 (father), PW-4 (Smt. Kamla, mother), and PW-6 (Jetha Ram, uncle), testified about dowry demands and harassment meted out to Kamlesh soon after marriage.",
    "PW-2 testified he visited Kamlesh at her matrimonial home and observed her distress, and the accused complained about insufficient dowry.",
    "Post-mortem report (Ex. P-11) indicated death due to shock as a result of extensive (90%) ante-mortem burns. Kerosene smell was detected.",
    "The Trial Court acquitted all accused (Om Prakash - husband, Mangi Lal - father-in-law, Surji Devi - mother-in-law), disbelieving the prosecution witnesses on dowry demands and considering the possibility of accident or suicide.",
    "The High Court, on appeal by the State, reversed the acquittal. It convicted Om Prakash under Section 304B IPC and sentenced him to 7 years RI. It also convicted Om Prakash, Mangi Lal, and Surji Devi under Section 498A IPC and sentenced them to 2 years RI each. Sentences were concurrent.",
    "The accused (Respondents herein) did not appeal the High Court judgment; this appeal was filed by the State of Rajasthan seeking enhancement of sentence or conviction under Section 302 IPC.",
    "The Supreme Court primarily examined the correctness of the High Court's conviction based on the evidence, despite the appeal's focus being enhancement (implicitly reviewing the conviction itself)."
