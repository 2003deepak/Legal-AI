  "facts": [
    "Bachan Singh was convicted for the murder of three individuals: Desa Singh, Durga Bai, and Veeran Bai.",
    "The conviction was based on evidence presented during the trial.",
    "The Sessions Court found Bachan Singh guilty under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sentenced him to death.",
    "The High Court of Punjab & Haryana confirmed the death sentence.",
    "Bachan Singh appealed to the Supreme Court of India.",
    "The primary ground for appeal was the constitutional validity of the death penalty provided under Section 302 IPC.",
    "The appeal challenged Section 302 IPC as violative of Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India.",
    "A constitution bench of the Supreme Court heard the matter due to the significant constitutional questions involved.",
    "The specific details of the murders (dates, locations, method) are secondary in the Supreme Court judgment, which focuses on the legal and constitutional challenge to the death penalty itself, although the brutality of the crime likely influenced the initial sentencing."

      "The Court held that Section 302 IPC does not violate Articles 14, 19, or 21 of the Constitution.",
      "Reference to the 35th Law Commission Report and legislative history indicated that Parliament intended to retain the death penalty.",
      "Article 21 permits deprivation of life according to 'procedure established by law', provided the procedure is fair, just, and reasonable (following Maneka Gandhi). The existing criminal procedure (CrPC, Evidence Act) was considered fair.",
      "The Court overruled the view taken in Rajendra Prasad regarding the scope of 'special reasons' under Section 354(3) CrPC.",
      "It held that the discretion granted to judges under Section 302 IPC read with Section 354(3) CrPC is not unguided. Aggravating and mitigating circumstances must be considered.",
      "Crucially, the Court formulated the 'rarest of rare cases' principle: Life imprisonment is the rule, and death penalty an exception, to be imposed only when the alternative option is 'unquestionably foreclosed'.",
      "The Court mandated a balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances relating to both the crime and the criminal.",
      "The death penalty does not extinguish Article 19 rights in an impermissible manner, as these rights are not absolute.",
      "While acknowledging the global trend towards abolition and the lack of conclusive proof of deterrence, the Court deferred to legislative wisdom in retaining the penalty for exceptional cases.",
      "Justice P.N. Bhagwati dissented, holding the death penalty under Section 302 to be unconstitutional, arbitrary, and violative of Articles 14 and 21."
