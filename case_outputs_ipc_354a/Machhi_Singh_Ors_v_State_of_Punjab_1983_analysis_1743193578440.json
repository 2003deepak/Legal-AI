    "Victims included men, women, and children.",
    "The manner of killing was reported as brutal, involving firearms and potentially other weapons.",

    "Evidence included eyewitness testimonies, recovery of weapons (though potentially contested), and medical reports confirming multiple deaths due to injuries inflicted.",
    "Trial Court convicted the appellants under Section 302 read with Section 149 of the IPC and sentenced several of them, including Machhi Singh, Kashmir Singh, and Jagir Singh, to death. Others received life imprisonment.",

      "The Court found the evidence sufficient to establish the formation of an unlawful assembly with the common object of committing murder.",
      "Eyewitness testimonies, despite potential enmity, were found credible and corroborated by circumstances and medical evidence.",
      "The core of the judgment focused on the sentencing aspect, specifically the application of the death penalty.",
      "The Court reaffirmed the 'rarest of rare' principle laid down in Bachan Singh.",
      "Crucially, the Court elaborated on Bachan Singh by formulating guidelines (often referred to as the 'Machhi Singh guidelines') to assist courts in identifying 'rarest of rare' cases. These guidelines considered:",
      "  - Manner of Commission of Murder (e.g., extreme brutality, depravity).",
      "  - Motive for Commission of Murder (e.g., heinous motive like gain or vendetta causing mass casualties).",
      "  - Anti-social or Socially Abhorrent Nature of the Crime (e.g., bride burning, dowry death).",
      "  - Magnitude of Crime (e.g., multiple murders).",
      "  - Personality of Victim of Murder (e.g., helpless child, woman, public figure killed for political reasons).",
      "Applying these guidelines, the Court concluded that the present case, involving the massacre of 17 people stemming from vendetta, fell into the 'rarest of rare' category due to its magnitude, brutality, and the calculated nature of the attack targeting multiple households.",
      "The Court found that the aggravating circumstances (massacre, targeting multiple families, calculated attack) heavily outweighed any potential mitigating factors presented.",
      "The sentence of life imprisonment was deemed inadequate for the principal accused responsible for the planning and execution of the massacre."
