    "outcome": "Appeal partly allowed. The conviction of the appellant Madan under Section 302 IPC was set aside and altered to conviction under Section 304 Part II IPC. The sentence of Life Imprisonment was modified to Rigorous Imprisonment for 7 years.",

      "The Supreme Court accepted the concurrent findings of the Trial Court and High Court regarding the appellant Madan being the assailant who caused the head injury to the deceased, based on consistent eyewitness testimonies (PW-1, PW-2, PW-3) corroborated by medical evidence.",
      "The Court determined that the crucial issue was whether the offence constituted Murder (S.302) or Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder (S.304).",
      "The Court noted the incident arose from a 'sudden fight' over a trivial 'nali' dispute, without any premeditation or pre-existing enmity pointing towards an intention to kill.",
      "The weapon used was a 'lathi', considered an agricultural implement, not specifically chosen as a deadly weapon.",
      "The appellant inflicted only a 'single blow'.",
      "Considering these factors (sudden fight, no premeditation, trivial cause, single blow, nature of weapon), the Court concluded that the case falls under Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder.",
      "The Court analyzed Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC (sudden fight) and found the circumstances aligned with it.",
      "The Court differentiated between intention and knowledge. While the appellant may not have intended to cause death or the specific fatal injury (negating S.302 and S.304 Part I), he possessed the knowledge that hitting someone on the head with a lathi was likely to cause death.",
      "Therefore, the Court held that the appropriate conviction was under Section 304 Part II IPC (culpable homicide committed with knowledge that the act is likely to cause death, but without intention to cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death)."
