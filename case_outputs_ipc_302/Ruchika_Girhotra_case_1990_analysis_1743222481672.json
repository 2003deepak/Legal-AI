  "facts": [
    "In August 1990, Ruchika Girhotra (aged 14/15), a tennis trainee, was allegedly molested by Shambu Pratap Singh Rathore (S.P.S. Rathore), then Inspector General of Police (IGP) Haryana and President of the Haryana Lawn Tennis Association (HLTA), at his official residence-cum-HLTA office in Panchkula.",
    "Ruchika's friend Aradhana Prakash was reportedly present during or immediately after the incident and witnessed Ruchika's distress.",
    "Ruchika confided in Aradhana's parents, Anand Prakash and Madhu Prakash.",
    "Ruchika's father, S.C. Girhotra, filed departmental complaints against Rathore shortly after the incident.",
    "Following the complaints, Ruchika was expelled from her school (Sacred Heart Convent, Chandigarh) allegedly due to pressure.",
    "The Girhotra family faced alleged systematic harassment orchestrated by Rathore using his police influence.",
    "Ruchika's brother, Ashu Girhotra, was implicated in multiple cases of alleged auto theft and other offences between 1992-1993, leading to his arrest and alleged torture.",
    "On December 28, 1993, Ruchika Girhotra consumed poison.",
    "On December 29, 1993, Ruchika Girhotra died.",
    "Allegations surfaced regarding tampering of the post-mortem report to obscure the cause of death or circumstances.",
    "Anand and Madhu Prakash pursued the case persistently.",
    "In 1997/1998, Anand Prakash and Madhu Prakash filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Punjab and Haryana High Court.",
    "The High Court transferred the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2000.",
    "CBI filed chargesheet against Rathore primarily under Section 354 IPC (Molestation).",
    "On December 21, 2009, a Special CBI Court in Chandigarh convicted S.P.S. Rathore under Section 354 IPC and sentenced him to 6 months Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) and a fine of â‚¹1,000.",
    "On May 25, 2010, the Chandigarh Sessions Court upheld the conviction and enhanced the sentence to 1.5 years RI.",
    "Following public outcry and further legal action, CBI filed a supplementary chargesheet including charges under Section 306 IPC (Abetment of Suicide).",
    "In 2010, charges under Section 306 IPC were framed against Rathore by the trial court.",
    "On May 26, 2016, the Supreme Court of India upheld Rathore's conviction under Section 354 IPC but reduced the sentence to the period already undergone (approximately 6 months), citing the protracted trial duration (26 years), Rathore's advanced age, and lack of prior convictions.",
    "On September 6, 2017, the Special CBI Court in Panchkula acquitted S.P.S. Rathore of the charges under Section 306 IPC (Abetment of Suicide), citing lack of sufficient evidence to establish a direct link or instigation.",
    "Judicial observations noted the 'blemish' on Rathore's career due to the conviction (SC) and the failure to prove abetment beyond reasonable doubt (Trial Court for 306)."

The evidence did not meet the high threshold ('beyond reasonable doubt') required to prove instigation or intentional aiding leading directly to the suicide, especially given the significant time gap and lack of definitive proof like a suicide note directly implicating Rathore for the suicide itself."
