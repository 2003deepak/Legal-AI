The court will determine whether the act falls within the scope of Section 300 (Murder) or Section 299 (Culpable Homicide).

If the prosecution fails to prove intention/knowledge beyond reasonable doubt, conviction may be for a lesser offense or acquittal.",

      "The court will analyze the evidence to determine the intention of the accused. If the intention to cause death or knowledge that the act would likely cause death is established, it would be murder. If the intention is absent, but the act was done with the knowledge that it was likely to cause death, or with the intention of causing bodily injury likely to cause death, it could be culpable homicide not amounting to murder.",
      "The presence of any exceptions to Section 300 would also be considered. If the act was committed under grave and sudden provocation, in the exercise of private defense, or in a sudden fight without premeditation, it would reduce the culpability of the accused.",
      "The burden of proving the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt rests with the prosecution. If there is any doubt, the benefit of the doubt would be given to the accused."
