  "facts": [
    "Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (Respondent/Accused) was married to Usha Jain (Deceased) on May 11, 1975.",
    "Usha Jain died due to extensive burn injuries sustained in her matrimonial home in Pune on December 11, 1982, around 8:00-8:30 PM.",
    "The death occurred more than seven years after the marriage.",
    "The prosecution alleged that the accused, dissatisfied with the deceased and desiring to marry another woman (Saroj), had been mentally and physically harassing Usha.",
    "Allegations included demands for money from Usha's parents, specific instances of ill-treatment, and threats.",
    "Several letters written by the deceased to her parents and relatives between 1978 and December 9, 1982, were presented as evidence, detailing her unhappiness, the accused's behaviour, his alleged affair, and her fears.",
    "A specific letter dated December 9, 1982 (Ex. 32), mentioned threats by the accused that she would meet the same fate as another woman ('Shakuntala') who was allegedly burnt by her husband.",
    "The defense claimed it was a case of suicide, possibly due to Usha's own frustrations or mental state.",
    "The Trial Court (Sessions Judge, Pune) convicted the accused under Section 302 IPC and sentenced him to life imprisonment (Judgment dated October 31, 1983).",
    "The High Court of Bombay acquitted the accused, primarily doubting the reliability of the letters and finding the possibility of suicide not ruled out (Judgment dated March 12, 1984).",
    "The State of Maharashtra appealed the acquittal to the Supreme Court.",
    "Medical evidence (Post-mortem report by Dr. Chitale, PW 18) confirmed death due to extensive burns (98-99% surface area). Kerosene smell was detected."

      "The Supreme Court concluded that the chain of circumstantial evidence (motive, prior conduct/threats detailed in letters, unnatural death by burning with kerosene) was complete and pointed conclusively to the guilt of the accused.",
