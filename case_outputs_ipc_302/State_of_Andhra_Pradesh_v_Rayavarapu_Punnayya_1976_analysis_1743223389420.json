  "facts": [
    "Accused No. 1 (A-1, Rayavarapu Punnayya) and Accused No. 2 (A-2, Rayavarapu Jaggaraju) were charged in connection with the death of Jagannadham.",
    "Incident occurred on June 13, 1969.",
    "A quarrel took place between A-1, A-2 and the deceased (Jagannadham).",
    "During the quarrel, A-1 stabbed the deceased with a spear ('barchi') in the abdomen.",
    "The injury caused was a single penetrating wound to the abdomen.",
    "The deceased was hospitalized and received medical treatment.",
    "The deceased died on June 20, 1969, seven days after the incident.",
    "Medical evidence (post-mortem report) established the cause of death as peritonitis and secondary shock resulting from the spear injury to the abdomen.",
    "The Trial Court acquitted A-1 of the charge under Section 302 IPC, but convicted him under Section 324 IPC (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons). A-2 was also convicted under Section 324 IPC.",
    "The State of Andhra Pradesh appealed the acquittal of A-1 under Section 302 IPC to the High Court.",
    "The High Court allowed the State's appeal, set aside the acquittal under Section 302 IPC, and convicted A-1 under Section 302 IPC, sentencing him to life imprisonment. The High Court maintained A-2's conviction under Section 324 IPC.",
    "A-1 (Rayavarapu Punnayya) appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court."

      "The Supreme Court undertook a detailed analysis distinguishing Culpable Homicide (Sec 299) and Murder (Sec 300).",
      "The court clarified that while the injury was dangerous and caused death, the evidence suggested A-1 possessed the 'knowledge' that his act (stabbing with a spear in the abdomen) was likely to cause death (fitting Sec 299 Clause (c)).",
      "The court found that the specific 'intention' required for Murder under Sec 300 Clause Thirdly (intention to cause bodily injury sufficient *in the ordinary course of nature* to cause death) was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.",
      "The distinction lies in the degree of probability or likelihood of death resulting from the intended act. While the act was culpable homicide, it did not meet the higher threshold of intention specified in Sec 300, Clause Thirdly, as interpreted in Virsa Singh.",
      "The court likely considered the single blow and the context of the quarrel, inferring knowledge rather than the specific intent required for murder.",
      "Therefore, the act constituted Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder, punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC, which applies when the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death."
