      "A higher degree of mens rea (intention) is required for S. 306 than for S. 498A. The accused must have intended the consequences of the act (i.e., suicide).",

      "The evidence on record, even if accepted regarding harassment, did not meet the threshold for proving abetment of suicide under S. 306 IPC beyond reasonable doubt.",
      "The acquittal under S. 302 was considered justified due to lack of evidence proving homicide.",
      "The acquittal under S. 498A by both lower courts (Trial Court acquitted, HC confirmed acquittal under this section) was not interfered with, likely due to perceived lack of reliable evidence.",
