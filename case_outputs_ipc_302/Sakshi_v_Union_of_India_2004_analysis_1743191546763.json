    "The case pertains to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) relating to the definition of rape.",
    "Sakshi, an NGO working for women's rights, filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) challenging the constitutionality and scope of Section 375 IPC.",
    "The PIL argued that the existing definition of rape in Section 375 IPC was narrow and discriminatory as it only recognized penetration of the penis into the vagina as rape.",
    "The petition highlighted the exclusion of other forms of sexual assault such as oral sex, anal sex, and forced penetration by objects.",
    "The petition also challenged the exception provided in Section 375 IPC, which exempts sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, from the definition of rape (marital rape exception)."
