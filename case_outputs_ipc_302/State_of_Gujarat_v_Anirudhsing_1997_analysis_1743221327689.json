  "facts": [
    "The case involves an appeal by the State of Gujarat against the acquittal of the respondents (Anirudhsing and potentially others, specific relationship to the deceased not detailed in summary) by the High Court.",
    "The respondents were initially tried and convicted by the Sessions Court under Sections 498A and 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).",
    "The deceased, wife of one of the respondents (details inferred, likely Anirudhsing), died by suicide.",
    "The prosecution alleged that the deceased was subjected to cruelty and harassment by the respondents in connection with demands for dowry, which led her to commit suicide.",
    "Evidence presented likely included testimonies of the deceased's relatives (parents/siblings) regarding the alleged cruelty and demands.",
    "Medical evidence (post-mortem report) would have confirmed the cause of death as suicide.",
    "The specific nature and timing of the alleged cruelty and demands, and the timeframe between the last alleged act of cruelty and the suicide, were key factual elements under consideration.",
    "The Sessions Court found the evidence sufficient to establish cruelty under Section 498A and concluded that this cruelty constituted abetment leading to the suicide under Section 306 IPC, possibly invoking the presumption under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act.",
    "The High Court, on appeal by the accused, re-evaluated the evidence and acquitted the respondents, likely finding the evidence insufficient to prove either cruelty under 498A beyond reasonable doubt or that such cruelty directly led to or constituted abetment of suicide under Section 306.",
    "The State of Gujarat appealed the High Court's acquittal to the Supreme Court."

      "To establish abetment under Section 306, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused instigated the suicide or engaged in a conspiracy or intentionally aided the commission of suicide.",
      "The Court likely found that the evidence, while potentially indicating some harassment or cruelty (sufficient perhaps for 498A, though acquitted on that too by HC), did not reach the threshold required to prove active instigation or aiding necessary for a Section 306 conviction.",
      "The requirement of a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid the commission of suicide was emphasized.",
      "The High Court's appreciation of evidence was found to be reasonable and not perverse, warranting no interference in an appeal against acquittal.",
      "The presumption under Section 113A of the Evidence Act is rebuttable and does not automatically apply or suffice for conviction under Section 306 without proof of direct abetment as defined in Section 107 IPC.",
