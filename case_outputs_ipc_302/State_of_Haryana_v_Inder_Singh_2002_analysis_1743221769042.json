  "facts": [
    "Marriage between Inder Singh (Accused No. 1) and the deceased, Rajbala, took place about one and a half years prior to the incident.",
    "On 24.11.1988, Rajbala died by hanging in her matrimonial home in Village Sisana, District Rohtak, Haryana.",
    "Raj Singh (PW-3), father of the deceased, lodged an FIR (Ex. P-A) on 25.11.1988 at Police Station Kharkhoda.",
    "The FIR alleged that Inder Singh (husband), Rajinder Singh (brother-in-law, Accused No. 2), and Jasbir Singh (father-in-law, Accused No. 3) had been demanding dowry (fridge, scooter, cash) since the marriage.",
    "It was alleged that due to non-fulfillment of demands, Rajbala was harassed and maltreated.",
    "PW-3 stated that about 10-12 days before the incident, his son Satyavir (PW-4) had visited Rajbala, who complained about the continued harassment and demands.",
    "PW-3 and PW-4 testified regarding specific demands and instances of harassment.",
    "Post-mortem examination (report Ex. P-C) conducted by Dr. J.S. Punia (PW-1) concluded the cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging.",
    "The Trial Court (Additional Sessions Judge, Rohtak) convicted all three accused under Sections 304B/34 and 498A/34 IPC, sentencing them to 7 years RI for 304B and 2 years RI + fine for 498A, sentences to run concurrently.",
    "On appeal, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana upheld the convictions.",
    "The High Court, however, reduced the sentence of Rajinder Singh and Jasbir Singh under Section 304B IPC from 7 years to 5 years RI, while maintaining Inder Singh's sentence.",
    "Inder Singh (husband), Rajinder Singh (brother-in-law), and Jasbir Singh (father-in-law) appealed to the Supreme Court.",
    "The Supreme Court noted the death occurred within 7 years of marriage under circumstances raising concerns about dowry harassment."
