  "facts": [
    "On 20.01.1990, in the evening, Venkatamma (aged 8 years), the deceased victim, went out to answer nature's call near Gollarahatti, Hiriyur Taluk, Chitradurga District, Karnataka.",
    "The accused, Krishnappa, allegedly followed her, caught hold of her, took her to a secluded place near a 'jali' tree.",
    "The accused allegedly committed rape upon the victim.",
    "The accused allegedly inflicted injuries on the victim, including biting her cheek and throttling her neck.",
    "The victim returned home crying, injured and bleeding.",
    "Upon inquiry by her mother, Parvathamma (PW-1), and grandmother, Thippamma (PW-2), the victim stated that Krishnappa (the accused) had committed rape on her and caused injuries.",
    "The victim was taken to the Government Hospital at Hiriyur the same evening.",
    "Dr. B.G. Patil (PW-11) examined the victim and found injuries consistent with rape and assault (including teeth marks on the cheek, abrasions on the neck, injury to private parts).",
    "A complaint (Ex. P-10) was lodged by PW-1 based on the victim's statement.",
    "The victim's statement was formally recorded by the police Sub-Inspector (Ex. P-11) in the hospital, treated as a dying declaration, wherein she reiterated naming Krishnappa as the assailant.",
    "The victim succumbed to her injuries on 22.01.1990.",
    "Post-mortem examination confirmed injuries consistent with the prosecution's case.",
    "The Trial Court acquitted the accused, disbelieving the dying declaration primarily due to lack of medical certification regarding the victim's state of mind at the time of recording Ex. P-11 and lack of independent corroboration.",
    "The High Court of Karnataka upheld the acquittal.",
    "The State of Karnataka appealed to the Supreme Court against the acquittal."
