    "The specific act involved the respondent causing injuries to the victim's vagina, including rupture of the hymen, indicating some form of penetration.",
    "The incident occurred on March 13, 1962, in the evening.",
    "Medical examination by Dr. R. L. Bhandari confirmed the injuries (vaginal tear, hymenal rupture, bleeding).",
    "The Sessions Judge convicted Major Singh under Section 354 IPC.",
    "The High Court of Punjab acquitted Major Singh on appeal, reasoning that a female child of 7.5 months could not possess a 'sense of modesty' and therefore, her modesty could not be outraged.",

      "argument": "The offense under Section 354 IPC requires the victim to have a developed sense of modesty capable of being outraged.

    "outcome": "Appeal Allowed. The acquittal order of the High Court was set aside, and the conviction of Major Singh under Section 354 IPC by the Sessions Judge was restored (Majority decision: Sarkar and Mudholkar JJ.; Minority dissenting view: Bachawat J.).",
    "reasoning": [
      "Majority View (Sarkar & Mudholkar JJ.):",
      "The term 'woman' in Section 354 IPC, read with Section 10 IPC, includes a female human being of any age, including an infant.",
      "'Modesty' is an essential attribute of the female sex. It is not a subjective concept dependent on the victim's age or understanding. It is an objective standard related to female bodily integrity and decency.",
      "The intention or knowledge of the accused must be judged concerning the act itself (whether it is indecent) and the victim being female, not based on the victim's subjective reaction.",
      "The act of the accused (injuring the vagina) was inherently indecent and constituted an affront to the objective modesty associated with the female sex.",
      "The essence of a woman's modesty is her sex, and the culpable intention of the accused is the crux of the matter.",
      "Minority View (Bachawat J.):",
      "Agreed that 'woman' includes a female child.",
      "Differed on the interpretation of 'modesty', arguing it relates to propriety, decency, and chastity, implying a degree of understanding or development that an infant lacks.",
      "An infant does not possess the attribute of 'modesty' in the sense required by Section 354.",
      "The act committed was an indecent assault but did not constitute 'outraging the modesty' of the infant victim under S. 354. It could potentially be punished under other sections like assault or hurt."
