  "facts": [
    "Incident occurred on October 29, 1992, around 7:30 PM in the fields near Village Nangal Sirohi, District Mahendergarh, Haryana.",
    "Parties involved: Accused side - Bhagirath, Jagdish (appellants, sons), Hukmi (father); Complainant/Deceased side - Jeet Singh (deceased), Chhotu Ram (deceased), Balbir Singh (PW4, eyewitness), Rattan Singh.",
    "Prosecution version (per PW4 Balbir Singh): Accused were found cutting Bajra crop from a field claimed by Balbir Singh's father. When the complainant party objected, Hukmi exhorted his sons to attack. Bhagirath attacked Jeet Singh with a 'jailly' (spear/pitchfork), and Jagdish attacked Chhotu Ram with a 'jailly'. Hukmi allegedly wielded a lathi. Jeet Singh and Chhotu Ram died due to injuries.",
    "Defense version (Accused statements under S.313 CrPC, DW1 testimony): The field belonged to the accused (supported by revenue records). The complainant party were the aggressors, armed with weapons ('kassi', 'jailly'), attempting to forcibly take possession or harvest the crop. Chhotu Ram allegedly hit Hukmi with a 'kassi', and Jeet Singh hit Bhagirath with a 'jailly'. Bhagirath claimed he snatched the 'jailly' from Jeet Singh and struck back in self-defense. Jagdish claimed he hit Chhotu Ram in self-defense.",
    "Medical Evidence: Jeet Singh had three incised wounds, including a fatal penetrating wound in the chest. Chhotu Ram had one fatal penetrating wound in the chest. Accused Hukmi had a lacerated wound, abrasions, and contusion. Accused Bhagirath had an abrasion.",
    "Trial Court: Convicted Bhagirath and Jagdish under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC (life imprisonment). Acquitted Hukmi. Rejected the plea of private defense.",
    "High Court: Upheld the Trial Court's conviction and sentence.",
    "Supreme Court: Appeal filed by Bhagirath and Jagdish against the High Court's judgment."

    "outcome": "Appeal allowed in part. Conviction altered from Section 302/34 IPC to Section 304 Part I IPC for both appellants (Bhagirath and Jagdish). Sentence reduced from life imprisonment to Rigorous Imprisonment for 7 years for both.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Court acknowledged the land dispute but focused on the confrontation itself.",
      "The injuries on accused persons (Hukmi and Bhagirath) lent credence to the defense version that the complainant party was also aggressive and likely initiated the physical altercation.",
      "The prosecution failed to explain the injuries on the accused, casting doubt on its version of the incident as a one-sided attack.",
      "Based on the circumstances, including the accused's injuries, the Court concluded that the accused had a right of private defense of person against the attack initiated by the complainant party.",
      "However, the Court held that the appellants *exceeded* their right of private defense. Using a 'jailly' to inflict fatal penetrating injuries on the chests of the deceased was disproportionate to the threat perceived, especially as the deceased were not shown to be armed in a manner justifying lethal force in return (or were potentially disarmed per defense version).",
      "The act fell under Exception 2 to Section 300 IPC: exceeding the right of private defense in good faith, without premeditation, and without intending more harm than necessary for defense.",
      "Since the injuries were inflicted on vital parts (chest) with a dangerous weapon ('jailly'), the intention to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death was evident, thus attracting Section 304 Part I IPC, not Part II."
