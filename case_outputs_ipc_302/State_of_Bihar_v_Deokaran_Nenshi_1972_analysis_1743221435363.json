  "facts": [
    "The respondents, Deokaran Nenshi and another, were the owner and manager respectively of a stone quarry in Jamunia, Bihar.",
    "They were required under Regulation 11 of the Indian Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1926 (read with the Mines Act, 1952) to furnish annual returns for the year ending December 31, 1959.",
    "The statutory deadline for furnishing these returns was January 21, 1960.",
    "The respondents failed to furnish the annual returns by the due date.",
    "A complaint was filed against the respondents by the Inspector of Mines on May 12, 1960, before the Magistrate, First Class, Dhanbad.",
    "The Trial Magistrate convicted the respondents on March 31, 1961, under Regulation 11 read with Section 66 of the Mines Act, 1952, imposing a fine of Rs. 200/- each.",
    "The respondents' appeal to the Sessions Court was dismissed.",
    "The respondents filed a revision petition before the High Court of Patna.",
    "The High Court allowed the revision, set aside the conviction and sentence, and acquitted the respondents.",
    "The High Court's decision was based on the interpretation of Section 79 of the Mines Act, 1952, holding that the offence was completed on January 21, 1960, and the complaint filed on May 12, 1960, was barred by the six-month limitation period.",
    "The State of Bihar appealed the High Court's acquittal order to the Supreme Court."

  "ipc_sections": [
    "None directly applied for conviction. The case primarily involved provisions of the Mines Act, 1952 and the Indian Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1926. The core legal principle analyzed was the concept of a 'continuing offence', which is relevant across criminal law, including certain IPC offences (e.g., wrongful confinement), but no specific IPC section was invoked against the accused in this matter."

  "prosecution_arguments": [
    {
      "argument": "The failure to furnish annual returns by the specified date constitutes a continuing offence, which persisted each day the default continued after January 21, 1960. Therefore, the complaint filed on May 12, 1960, was within the limitation period prescribed by Section 79 of the Mines Act, 1952.",

  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Appeal Dismissed. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's order of acquittal.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Supreme Court analyzed the concept of a 'continuing offence'. A continuing offence is one which is susceptible of continuance and is distinguishable from an offence which is committed once and for all.",
      "The Court held that the requirement under Regulation 11 was to furnish the annual returns by January 21, 1960.",
      "The contravention occurred and was complete on January 21, 1960, when the owner failed to furnish the returns by that date.",
      "The Regulation does not stipulate that the owner/manager would be guilty of an offence for every day thereafter that the default continued.",
      "The Court explicitly distinguished this from statutes where a daily fine is imposed for continued non-compliance (like in *Best v. Butler*), which would indicate a legislative intent to create a continuing offence.",
      "Since the offence was complete on January 21, 1960, the limitation period under Section 79 of the Mines Act began to run from that date.",
      "The complaint filed on May 12, 1960, was beyond the six-month limitation period.",
      "Therefore, the prosecution was time-barred, and the High Court correctly acquitted the respondents."
