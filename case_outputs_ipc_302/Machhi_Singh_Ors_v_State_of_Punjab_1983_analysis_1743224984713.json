      "Applying these guidelines, the Court concluded that the present case, involving the massacre of 17 people stemming from a vendetta, exhibited extreme brutality and magnitude, shocking the collective conscience.",
      "The Court held that the aggravating circumstances (scale, planning, brutality, targeting innocents) heavily outweighed any mitigating factors presented.",
      "It concluded that the case fell within the 'rarest of rare' category where the alternative of life imprisonment was inadequate, thus justifying the confirmation of the death sentences."
