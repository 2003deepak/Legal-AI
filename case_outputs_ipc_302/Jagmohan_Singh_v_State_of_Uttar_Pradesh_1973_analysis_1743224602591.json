    "Specific arguments included: lack of legislative guidelines for imposing death vs. life imprisonment, rendering the choice arbitrary (violating Articles 14 and 21); and that the death penalty constitutes an unreasonable restriction on fundamental freedoms under Article 19."

It reasoned that this discretion is to be exercised judicially, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the case, including aggravating and mitigating factors. Providing exhaustive legislative standards was deemed impossible.",
      "The Court observed that the retention of the death penalty was a matter of legislative policy and it was not for the Court to question the wisdom of the legislature unless the provision was constitutionally invalid.",
      "The Court found no reason to interfere with the conviction and sentence based on the facts of the specific murder case (details often omitted in constitutional analysis sections)."
