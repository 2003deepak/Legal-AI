  "facts": [
    "Marriage between C. Mangesh (Appellant No. 1/Accused No. 1 - A-1) and deceased Manjula on 15.05.1996.",
    "Alleged demand of Rs. 10,000 cash and 50 grams gold as dowry at the time of marriage.",
    "Rs. 5,000 cash and 25 grams gold were allegedly given, with a promise to pay the balance later.",
    "Prosecution alleged continuous harassment and torture of Manjula by A-1 (husband), A-2 (father-in-law T. Venkatappa), and A-3 (brother-in-law T. Narayanappa) for the remaining dowry.",
    "Manjula was allegedly sent back to her parental home after about 6 months due to non-payment.",
    "A panchayat was held, and Manjula was taken back to the matrimonial home.",
    "On 11.07.1997 (within 1 year and 2 months of marriage), Manjula was found dead by hanging in her matrimonial home in Madhugiri Taluk, Tumkur District.",
    "FIR registered based on the complaint by PW-1 (father of the deceased).",
    "Post-mortem examination conducted by Dr. Hanumantharaya (PW-12) opined death due to asphyxia as a result of hanging.",
    "Investigation led by PW-13 (Investigating Officer).",
    "Charge-sheet filed against A-1, A-2, and A-3 under Sections 498-A, 304-B, 302 read with Section 34 IPC, and Sections 3 & 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.",
    "Trial Court (Sessions Judge, Tumkur) acquitted all accused of all charges by judgment dated 31.01.2000, citing discrepancies in witness testimonies (PW-1, PW-2, PW-3) and lack of reliable evidence for dowry demand/cruelty 'soon before death'.",
    "State of Karnataka appealed to the High Court of Karnataka.",
    "High Court, by judgment dated 16.12.2005, reversed the acquittal in part: Convicted A-1, A-2, and A-3 under Section 304-B read with Section 34 IPC (7 years RI) and Section 498-A read with Section 34 IPC (3 years RI and fine of Rs. 2000 each). Acquittal under Section 302/34 IPC and Dowry Prohibition Act sections was confirmed.",
    "High Court found the trial court's acquittal regarding Sections 304-B and 498-A to be perverse, relying on testimonies of PW-1 (father), PW-2 (mother), PW-3 (brother) and invoking the presumption under Section 113-B of the Indian Evidence Act.",
    "The present appeal before the Supreme Court was filed by the convicted accused (A-1, A-2, A-3) against the High Court's judgment."
