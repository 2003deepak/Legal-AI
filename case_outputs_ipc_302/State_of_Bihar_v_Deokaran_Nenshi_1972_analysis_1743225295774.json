    "The respondents were the owners/agents of a stone quarry in Bihar.",
    "Under Regulation 3 of the Indian Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1926, framed under the Mines Act, they were required to furnish annual returns for the preceding year to the Chief Inspector of Mines by January 21st each year.",
    "The respondents failed to furnish the annual return for the year ending December 31, 1959, by the due date of January 21, 1960.",
    "An Inspector of Mines visited the quarry on May 12, 1960, and discovered this non-compliance.",
    "A complaint was filed against the respondents in the Court of a Magistrate, First Class, Sasaram, on April 12, 1961.",
    "The complaint alleged an offense under Regulation 3 read with Section 66 of the Mines Act, 1952.",
    "The Magistrate acquitted the respondents, holding that the prosecution was barred by limitation under Section 79 of the Mines Act, 1952.",
    "Section 79 stipulated that a complaint must be filed within six months of the date of the alleged offense or within six months of the date of discovery of the offense by the Inspector, whichever date is later.",
    "The State of Bihar appealed the acquittal to the Patna High Court, which upheld the Magistrate's decision.",
    "The State of Bihar then appealed to the Supreme Court of India.",
    "The core issue before the Supreme Court was whether the failure to furnish the annual return by the specified date constituted a continuing offense."

      "The regulation did not impose a penalty for every day the default continued after the deadline.",
      "Therefore, the offense was completed on January 21, 1960, and was not a continuing offense.",
      "Section 79 of the Mines Act requires the complaint to be filed within six months of the offense (Jan 21, 1960) or its discovery (May 12, 1960), whichever is later.",
      "The complaint was filed on April 12, 1961, which was more than six months after both January 21, 1960, and May 12, 1960.",
      "Consequently, the prosecution was barred by limitation under Section 79.",
      "The Court distinguished this from cases like *State of Bombay v. Bhiwandiwala*, where the offense (running a factory without a license) inherently continued daily."
