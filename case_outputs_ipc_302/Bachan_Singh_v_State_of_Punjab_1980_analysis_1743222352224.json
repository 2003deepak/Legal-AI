    "Bachan Singh was tried and convicted for the murders of Desa Singh, Durga Bai, and Veeran Bai.",
    "The Sessions Judge awarded Bachan Singh the death sentence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).",
    "The sentence was confirmed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.",
    "Bachan Singh appealed to the Supreme Court by special leave.",
    "The core issue before the Supreme Court's Constitution Bench was the constitutional validity of the death penalty provided under Section 302 IPC.",
    "The challenge was primarily based on alleged violations of Article 19 (Fundamental Freedoms) and Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) of the Constitution of India.",
    "Arguments also touched upon Article 14 (Equality before Law) concerning the discretionary power vested in courts.",
    "The case required examination of the sentencing procedure under Section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973, which mandates giving 'special reasons' for imposing the death penalty.",
    "Previous Supreme Court rulings like Jagmohan Singh v. State of U.P. (1973) and Rajendra Prasad v. State of U.P. (1979) had differing perspectives on the death penalty, necessitating a larger bench review."

      "Article 21 permits deprivation of life according to 'procedure established by law'. The procedure under CrPC 1973, particularly Section 354(3) requiring 'special reasons' for death sentence and making life imprisonment the norm, satisfies the 'fair, just, and reasonable' test laid down in Maneka Gandhi.",
      "The discretion vested in courts by Section 302 IPC and Section 354(3) CrPC is not unguided. It must be exercised judicially, weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances relating to both the crime and the criminal.",
      "The court formulated the 'rarest of rare' principle: The death penalty should not be imposed save in the 'rarest of rare cases' when the alternative option of life imprisonment is 'unquestionably foreclosed'.",
      "Mitigating circumstances (like potential for reform, age, mental condition, socio-economic background) must be given full weight.",
      "Aggravating circumstances (like extreme brutality, heinous nature of the crime, previous criminal record) must be considered.",
      "The judgment overruled the narrow interpretation provided in Rajendra Prasad v. State of U.P.",
