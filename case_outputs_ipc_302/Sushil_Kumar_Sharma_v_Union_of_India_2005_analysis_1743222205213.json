    "The petition challenged the constitutional validity of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).",

    "The petitioner contended that the provision was being widely misused by disgruntled wives and their families to harass husbands and their relatives.",

    "The petitioner sought a declaration that Section 498A IPC is unconstitutional, or alternatively, for the provision to be read down or for guidelines to be issued to prevent its misuse."

      "The classification of 'husband or relative of husband' was found to be based on an intelligible differentia having a rational nexus with the object of the Act, thus not violating Article 14.",
      "The definition of 'cruelty' provided in the Explanation to Section 498A was deemed sufficiently clear and not unconstitutionally vague. The Court noted that the definition covers both physical and mental cruelty related to unlawful demands.",
      "The Court emphatically stated that the mere possibility of misuse of a provision does not render it unconstitutional. While acknowledging that the provision might be misused by some, it held that this cannot be a ground for declaring the section ultra vires the Constitution.",
      "It was observed that the remedy for misuse lies in taking appropriate action against those filing false complaints and in careful handling of such cases by the police and courts.",
      "The Court stressed that the object of the legislation is laudable, aimed at protecting women, and striking it down would leave vulnerable women without legal recourse against cruelty.",
      "While upholding the validity, the Court implicitly recognized the concerns about misuse and underscored the need for caution by law enforcement agencies to ensure that innocent individuals are not harassed (foreshadowing later guidelines in other cases like Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar)."
