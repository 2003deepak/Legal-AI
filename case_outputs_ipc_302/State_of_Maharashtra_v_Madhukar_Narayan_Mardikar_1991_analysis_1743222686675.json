  "facts": [
    "Madhukar Narayan Mardikar (Respondent) was a Police Inspector in Maharashtra.",
    "A departmental enquiry was initiated against him based on a complaint by a woman named Banubi.",
    "Allegation: On the intervening night of 12th and 13th November 1965, the Respondent, in an intoxicated state, went to Banubi's hut, knocked, and when she opened, attempted to assault her or engage in inappropriate behaviour.",
    "Banubi raised an alarm, attracting neighbours, causing the Respondent to flee.",
    "The Enquiry Officer found the Respondent guilty of misconduct: visiting Banubi's residence alone at night under the influence of alcohol and behaving indecently.",
    "Based on the enquiry report, the Deputy Inspector General of Police dismissed the Respondent from service on July 6, 1967.",
    "The Respondent filed a Writ Petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the dismissal.",
    "The High Court quashed the dismissal order, primarily reasoning that Banubi was of 'easy virtue' or 'unchaste character' and therefore her testimony could not be relied upon, especially without corroboration, to penalize the officer.",
    "The High Court observed that visiting such a woman's house might be reprehensible but did not warrant dismissal for a police officer.",
    "The State of Maharashtra appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court."

    "Section 451 (House-trespass in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) - *Implied nature of alleged misconduct*",
