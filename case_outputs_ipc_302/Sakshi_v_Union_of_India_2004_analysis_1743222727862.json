  "facts": [
    "The petition was filed as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by Sakshi, an NGO working on child rights and prevention of child sexual abuse, along with other concerned parties.",
    "The petition challenged the constitutional validity and adequacy of the definition of 'rape' under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860.",
    "Petitioners argued that the definition was overly narrow as it only recognized penile-vaginal penetration as constituting rape.",
    "It was contended that this definition failed to adequately protect victims, particularly children, from other forms of penetrative sexual assault, such as oral, anal, digital, or object penetration.",
    "The petition highlighted the trauma faced by child victims during investigation and trial under the existing criminal justice procedures.",
    "Relief sought included broadening the definition of rape under Section 375 IPC to include all forms of penetration and seeking directions for procedural reforms to make the trial process more sensitive to child victims.",
    "The Law Commission of India's 172nd Report on 'Review of Rape Laws' (submitted in March 2000), which recommended significant changes to the definition of rape and trial procedures, was brought to the Court's attention and heavily relied upon.",
    "The Union of India was the primary respondent, representing the legislative and executive branches responsible for enacting and amending laws."

  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Petition partly allowed. The Supreme Court acknowledged the inadequacy of Section 375 IPC concerning child sexual abuse but declined to redefine 'rape' judicially, holding it to be a legislative function. However, the Court accepted the need for procedural reforms and issued guidelines for the trial of child sexual assault cases, largely based on the 172nd Law Commission Report, to be followed until Parliament enacts specific legislation.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Court agreed that Section 375 IPC was inadequate to address the realities of child sexual abuse, particularly non-vaginal penetrative assaults, which often went unpunished or were prosecuted under lesser offences.",
      "Invoked the doctrine of separation of powers and exercised judicial restraint, stating that defining or redefining a criminal offence like rape is fundamentally a legislative task for Parliament.",
      "Recognized the vulnerability of child witnesses and the trauma associated with the conventional adversarial trial process.",
      "Found merit in the recommendations of the 172nd Law Commission Report regarding procedural safeguards for child victims.",
      "Issued binding guidelines for lower courts including measures like in-camera trials, avoiding questions about past sexual history (reading down Section 155(4) of Indian Evidence Act, though this section was later omitted), use of screens, allowing support persons, and expediting trials.",
      "Emphasized India's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)."
