  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Appeal Allowed. The criminal proceedings initiated against the appellant Vikram Johar, arising out of Case Crime No. 0117 of 2017 for offences under Sections 406 and 420 IPC, were quashed.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Supreme Court found that the allegations in the FIR/Charge-Sheet did not disclose the essential ingredients of the offences of cheating (Section 420) or criminal breach of trust (Section 406).",
      "The Court emphasized the distinction between a mere breach of contract and the criminal offences of cheating and criminal breach of trust.",
      "For cheating (S.420), there was no sufficient allegation or material to suggest that the appellant had a fraudulent or dishonest intention *at the very time of making the promise* (i.e., entering the Agreement to Sell). Subsequent failure to fulfill the promise does not automatically imply initial dishonest intent.",
      "For criminal breach of trust (S.406), the Court observed that the transaction was purely commercial. The money paid was towards sale consideration. The Court likely reasoned that this did not constitute 'entrustment' in the manner required by Section 405 IPC, as the money becomes the seller's property upon payment under the agreement, subject to contractual obligations.",
      "The Court concluded that the dispute was essentially civil in nature, arising out of non-performance of a contract.",
      "Allowing the criminal proceedings to continue would amount to an abuse of the process of court, potentially using criminal law machinery to settle a civil dispute.",
      "The Court reiterated principles laid down in previous judgments regarding the quashing of criminal proceedings under Section 482 CrPC where the dispute is primarily civil."
