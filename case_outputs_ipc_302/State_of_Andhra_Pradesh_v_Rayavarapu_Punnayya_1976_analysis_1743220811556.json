  "facts": [
    "The case involved an appeal by the State of Andhra Pradesh against the High Court's acquittal of the respondents (originally accused A-1 and A-2) for the charge under Section 302 IPC.",
    "The incident occurred on February 14, 1969, around 8:00 AM in village Koppurru.",
    "There was prior enmity between the deceased (Jagannadham) and the accused party.",
    "On the day of the incident, the deceased was proceeding from his village towards the field of one K. Ramayya (PW 5).",
    "Accused A-1 (Rayavarapu Punnayya) and A-2 (Rayavarapu Peda Punnayya), along with three others (A-3 to A-5, who were acquitted by the Trial Court and whose acquittal was not challenged), waylaid the deceased.",
    "The accused were armed with sticks (variously described, but essentially lathis).",
    "A-1 and A-2 confronted the deceased regarding a prior incident involving PW 5.",
    "Following a brief altercation, A-1 and A-2 beat the deceased with their sticks.",
    "Multiple injuries were inflicted on the deceased, primarily on the legs and arms, but also vital areas including the head.",
    "Medical evidence (post-mortem report by Dr. K. Ramachandra Rao, PW 1) showed 20 injuries, including contusions, abrasions, and notably, fractures of the skull bones (temporal and parietal) leading to subdural hemorrhage.",
    "The doctor opined that the head injuries (specifically Injury No. 19 - fracture of left temporal and parietal bones) were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",
    "The deceased succumbed to his injuries later the same day at around 5:00 PM in the hospital.",
    "The Trial Court (Sessions Judge, Guntur) convicted A-1 and A-2 under Section 304 Part I read with Section 34 IPC, sentencing them to 5 years rigorous imprisonment.",
    "The High Court of Andhra Pradesh, on appeal by the accused, acquitted them of the charge under Section 304 Part I/34 IPC, but convicted them under Section 325 read with Section 34 IPC (grievous hurt), reducing the sentence to 3 years rigorous imprisonment.",
    "The State of Andhra Pradesh appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court's decision, arguing for conviction under Section 302/34 IPC.",
    "The Supreme Court noted the High Court erroneously focused only on the intention to cause death, neglecting the possibility of intention to cause injuries sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death (Clause 3 of Section 300)."

  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Supreme Court allowed the State's appeal. The High Court's judgment was set aside, and the Trial Court's conviction of A-1 and A-2 under Section 304 Part I read with Section 34 IPC was restored. (Note: The SC did not convict under S. 302 as initially argued by the State, but restored the S. 304 Part I conviction).",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Supreme Court provided a detailed exposition on the distinction between Culpable Homicide (S. 299) and Murder (S. 300).",
      "It clarified that 'intention' and 'knowledge' are distinct concepts involving different degrees of probability of death.",
      "Culpable homicide requires subjective knowledge (that death is likely), while Murder (specifically Clause 3 of S. 300) requires intention to cause an injury that is objectively sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",
      "The Court held that the High Court erred in focusing solely on the absence of intention to cause death (Clause 1 of S. 300) and ignoring Clause 3.",
      "The medical evidence clearly showed Injury No. 19 (head injury) was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",
      "The infliction of such a severe injury on a vital part (head) with lathis indicated an intention to cause that specific bodily injury.",
      "Therefore, the elements of Section 300 Clause (3) were prima facie satisfied.",
      "However, the Court considered the totality of circumstances: prior enmity, the nature of the initial confrontation, the use of lathis (not inherently deadly weapons like guns/knives), and that multiple blows were on non-vital parts, while the fatal blow was one among many.",
      "Considering these factors, the Court found it difficult to definitively attribute the specific intention required for Section 300(3) (intention to cause *that particular injury* which was sufficient to cause death) as opposed to an intention to cause injuries likely to cause death.",
      "It held that the common intention was clearly to severely beat the deceased, and the accused must have known their actions were likely to cause death OR intended to cause injuries likely to cause death.",
      "This mens rea fits squarely within Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder, punishable under Section 304 IPC.",
      "Given the intention to inflict severe injuries, including on the head, the Court deemed it appropriate to convict under Section 304 Part I (requiring intention to cause bodily injury likely to cause death), rather than Part II (requiring only knowledge).",
      "The Trial Court's conviction under Section 304 Part I/34 was thus found to be correct and was restored."
