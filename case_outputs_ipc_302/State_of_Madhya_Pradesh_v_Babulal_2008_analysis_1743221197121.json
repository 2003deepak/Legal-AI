    "The deceased, Neelam Bai, was married to the respondent, Babulal, approximately one year prior to the incident.",
    "On 21.05.1997, Neelam Bai consumed poison (Sulfas tablets) at her matrimonial home in Village Kharkhedi, District Shajapur, Madhya Pradesh.",
    "She was taken to the Primary Health Centre, Kalapipal, and later referred to District Hospital, Shajapur.",
    "A Dying Declaration (Ex. P-15) was recorded by the Executive Magistrate (Naib Tehsildar), PW-11, at the District Hospital on 21.05.1997 at around 7:30 PM.",
    "In the dying declaration, Neelam Bai alleged that her husband, Babulal, used to beat her after consuming liquor and harass her, demanding a motorcycle, which led her to consume poison.",
    "Dr. B.S. Kothari (PW-10) was present during the recording and certified her fitness to give the statement *after* it was recorded.",
    "Neelam Bai died on 22.05.1997.",
    "Post-mortem examination confirmed death due to poisoning.",
    "FIR was registered, and Babulal was charged under Section 306 IPC.",
    "Key prosecution witnesses included: PW-1 (father), PW-2 (mother), PW-3 (brother), PW-4 (uncle), PW-5 (neighbor), PW-7 (brother-in-law), PW-10 (Doctor), PW-11 (Executive Magistrate), PW-12 (Investigating Officer).",
    "The Trial Court (Sessions Judge, Shajapur) convicted Babulal under Section 306 IPC and sentenced him to 5 years Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-.",
    "The High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Indore Bench, acquitted Babulal, primarily disbelieving the dying declaration due to lack of prior fitness certification by the doctor and minor discrepancies.",
