    "Allegation: Appellant (Saddak Hussain), along with co-accused Mohd. Yameen and Mohd. Naushad @ Chhota, attacked PW-1 and the deceased with intent to rob.",
    "Sequence: PW-1 and deceased were walking. Accused persons stopped them. Mohd. Yameen allegedly caught hold of the deceased. Mohd. Naushad allegedly attacked the deceased with a knife. Saddak Hussain (appellant) allegedly hit the deceased on the head with a brick/stone.",
    "Robbery: Accused allegedly robbed the deceased's mobile phone (Motorola) and wallet containing Rs. 150/-.",
    "Reporting: PW-1 informed police. DD No. 31A recorded at PS Geeta Colony.",
