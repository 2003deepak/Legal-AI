    "Marriage between Arnesh Kumar (Appellant) and Sweta Kiran (Respondent No. 2) solemnized on July 1, 2007.",
    "Sweta Kiran alleged demands for dowry (Rs. 8 lakhs, a Maruti car, an air-conditioner, a television set etc.) soon after marriage.",
    "Allegations of cruelty and harassment against the husband (Arnesh Kumar), mother-in-law, father-in-law, and other relatives.",
    "Sweta Kiran was allegedly driven out of the matrimonial home due to non-fulfillment of dowry demands.",
    "FIR No. 95 of 2012 was registered on behalf of Sweta Kiran under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.",
    "Arnesh Kumar apprehended arrest based on the FIR.",
    "Arnesh Kumar filed an application for anticipatory bail (under Section 438 CrPC) before the Sessions Judge, Patna, which was rejected.",
    "Arnesh Kumar then filed an application for anticipatory bail before the High Court of Patna, which was also dismissed by order dated November 13, 2013.",
    "Arnesh Kumar filed a Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court of India against the High Court's order, challenging the denial of anticipatory bail and highlighting the routine nature of arrests under Section 498A IPC.",
    "The core issue before the Supreme Court was the interpretation and application of Section 41 and Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC) concerning the power of police to arrest, particularly in cases involving offences punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be less than seven years or which may extend to seven years, with or without fine, like Section 498A IPC."

  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Directions Issued; Appeal Allowed implicitly regarding Bail Principles: The Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of the 498A allegations but allowed the appeal in principle by laying down mandatory guidelines for police and magistrates regarding arrest procedures under Section 41 and 41A CrPC for offences punishable up to 7 years (including Section 498A IPC). The court directed these guidelines be followed, effectively setting the standard for whether arrest was justified, thereby impacting the basis on which bail was denied.",

      "Acknowledged the phenomenal increase in matrimonial disputes and the rampant misuse of Section 498A IPC, often used as a weapon rather than a shield.",
      "Emphasized that arrest brings humiliation, curtails freedom, and casts scars forever; it should not be the first step.",
      "Analyzed Section 41 CrPC (as amended), stressing that police officers must record reasons based on the checklist in Section 41(1)(b)(ii) before making an arrest for offences punishable up to 7 years.",
      "Highlighted that police must also record reasons for *not* making an arrest.",
      "Mandated the use of Section 41A CrPC (Notice of appearance) when arrest is not required under Section 41(1).",
      "Stressed the duty of the Magistrate, under Section 41(1)(b) read with other provisions, to verify police compliance with Section 41 requirements and recorded reasons before authorizing detention. Casual and mechanical authorization of detention was deprecated.",
      "Issued specific directions (often referred to as 'Arnesh Kumar Guidelines'):",
      "  - All State Governments to instruct police not to automatically arrest under Section 498A IPC/similar offences, but satisfy Section 41 CrPC parameters.",
      "  - Police to fill a checklist (containing specified sub-clauses of Section 41(1)(b)(ii)) and furnish reasons/materials justifying arrest.",
      "  - Magistrate to peruse the checklist and reasons before authorizing detention.",
      "  - Failure to comply by police officers would render them liable for departmental action and contempt of court.",
      "  - Failure by Judicial Magistrate to comply would render them liable for departmental action by the High Court.",
      "  - Notice under Section 41A CrPC to be served within 2 weeks of case institution if arrest not needed (extendable by SP).",
      "  - These directions apply to all cases with offences punishable up to 7 years imprisonment.",
      "The objective was to ensure that police officers do not arrest accused unnecessarily and magistrates do not authorize detention casually and mechanically."
