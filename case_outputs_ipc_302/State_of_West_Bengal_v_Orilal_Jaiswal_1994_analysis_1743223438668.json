    "The deceased, Uma Jaiswal, was married to Orilal Jaiswal (Respondent No. 1) in May 1981.",
    "Respondents No. 2 (Ayodhya Prasad Jaiswal) and No. 3 (Kalawati Devi) were the father-in-law and mother-in-law of the deceased.",
    "Allegations surfaced that soon after marriage, the deceased was subjected to persistent demands for dowry (cash, refrigerator, television set) and consequent torture, both mental and physical, by all three respondents.",
    "The deceased wrote letters to her father detailing the harassment and torture she faced due to unmet dowry demands.",
    "On July 25, 1984, Uma Jaiswal died due to burn injuries sustained after setting herself on fire at her matrimonial home.",
    "The Trial Court convicted all three respondents under Section 306 IPC (Abetment of Suicide) and sentenced them to imprisonment.",
    "The High Court, on appeal, acquitted all three respondents, primarily finding that the evidence did not establish abetment beyond reasonable doubt and that mere harassment might not amount to instigation.",

      "This prolonged cruelty created circumstances that left the deceased with no alternative but to end her life, thus amounting to abetment.",
      "The Court emphasized that Section 306 IPC must be interpreted contextually, especially in dowry-related cases, and sensitivity is required.",
      "The presumption under Section 113A of the Evidence Act was applicable given the suicide occurred within 7 years of marriage amidst proven cruelty, and the respondents failed to rebut this presumption.",
      "The High Court's reasoning for acquittal was deemed flawed and insensitive to the social context of dowry deaths."
