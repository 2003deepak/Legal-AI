    "Marriage between Gurdeep Kaur (deceased) and Ramdev Singh (Respondent/Accused) solemnized on 04.03.1990.",
    "Allegations surfaced soon after marriage that Ramdev Singh and his family started harassing Gurdeep Kaur for dowry, specifically demanding a scooter and cash.",
    "Due to alleged harassment and demands, Gurdeep Kaur returned to her parental home.",
    "Attempts were made by the deceased's family to convene a Panchayat (village council meeting) for resolution, but Ramdev Singh reportedly refused to participate.",
    "Gurdeep Kaur was subsequently sent back to her matrimonial home by her parents.",
    "The deceased wrote letters to her parents detailing the continued harassment and dowry demands.",
    "On 28.01.1991 (within approximately 11 months of marriage), Gurdeep Kaur died an unnatural death by strangulation in her matrimonial home.",
    "FIR was lodged by PW3, Balbir Singh (father of the deceased).",
    "Post-mortem examination confirmed the cause of death as asphyxia due to strangulation.",
    "Key prosecution witnesses included PW3 (father) and PW4 (mother) who testified regarding the dowry demands and harassment.",
    "The Trial Court convicted Ramdev Singh under Section 304-B IPC and sentenced him to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment.",
    "On appeal, the High Court acquitted Ramdev Singh, primarily finding that the prosecution failed to establish that the alleged dowry harassment occurred 'soon before' the death and casting doubt on the reliability of parental testimony.",
    "The State of Punjab filed an appeal against the High Court's acquittal order before the Supreme Court."
