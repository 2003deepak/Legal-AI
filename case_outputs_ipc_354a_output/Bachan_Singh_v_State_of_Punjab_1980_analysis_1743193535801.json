    "prompt": "Facts: Bachan Singh was convicted for the murder of three individuals: Desa Singh, Durga Bai, and Veeran Bai.; The conviction was based on evidence presented during the trial.; The Sessions Court found Bachan Singh guilty under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sentenced him to death.; The High Court of Punjab & Haryana confirmed the death sentence.; Bachan Singh appealed to the Supreme Court of India.; The primary ground for appeal was the constitutional validity of the death penalty provided under Section 302 IPC.; The appeal challenged Section 302 IPC as violative of Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India.; A constitution bench of the Supreme Court heard the matter due to the significant constitutional questions involved.; The specific details of the murders (dates, locations, method) are secondary in the Supreme Court judgment, which focuses on the legal and constitutional challenge to the death penalty itself, although the brutality of the crime likely influenced the initial sentencing. | IPC: Section 302 (Punishment for Murder)",
