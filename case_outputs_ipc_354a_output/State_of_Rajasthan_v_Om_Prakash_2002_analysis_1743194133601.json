    "prompt": "Facts: Marriage between Om Prakash (Respondent No. 1/Accused) and Kamlesh (deceased) solemnized on 25.04.1988.; Kamlesh died due to burn injuries at her matrimonial home in Village Mandawara, District Nagaur, Rajasthan on 08.09.1988.; The death occurred within approximately 4.5 months of the marriage.; Initial report (Ex. P-3) lodged by Om Prakash suggested accidental death due to stove bursting while preparing tea.; Bhanwar Lal (PW-2, father of the deceased) lodged a First Information Report (FIR) (Ex. P-1) on 09.09.1988 alleging that his daughter was harassed for dowry (demand for TV and Fridge) and killed by her husband and in-laws.; Prosecution witnesses, including PW-2 (father), PW-4 (Smt. Kamla, mother), and PW-6 (Jetha Ram, uncle), testified about dowry demands and harassment meted out to Kamlesh soon after marriage.; PW-2 testified he visited Kamlesh at her matrimonial home and observed her distress, and the accused complained about insufficient dowry.; Post-mortem report (Ex. P-11) indicated death due to shock as a result of extensive (90%) ante-mortem burns. Kerosene smell was detected.; The Trial Court acquitted all accused (Om Prakash - husband, Mangi Lal - father-in-law, Surji Devi - mother-in-law), disbelieving the prosecution witnesses on dowry demands and considering the possibility of accident or suicide.; The High Court, on appeal by the State, reversed the acquittal. It convicted Om Prakash under Section 304B IPC and sentenced him to 7 years RI. It also convicted Om Prakash, Mangi Lal, and Surji Devi under Section 498A IPC and sentenced them to 2 years RI each. Sentences were concurrent.; The accused (Respondents herein) did not appeal the High Court judgment; this appeal was filed by the State of Rajasthan seeking enhancement of sentence or conviction under Section 302 IPC.; The Supreme Court primarily examined the correctness of the High Court's conviction based on the evidence, despite the appeal's focus being enhancement (implicitly reviewing the conviction itself). | IPC: Section 304B (Dowry Death), Section 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Section 302 (Punishment for murder) - Considered but not applied by HC/SC for conviction., Section 113B, Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (Presumption as to dowry death)",
