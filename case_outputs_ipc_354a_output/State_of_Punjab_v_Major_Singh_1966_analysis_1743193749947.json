    "prompt": "Facts: The respondent, Major Singh, was accused of committing an offense under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code.; The victim was a female child aged 7 and a half months.; The incident occurred on March 13, 1962, around 6:00 PM in the village of Ludhiana district.; The child's mother found her crying and bleeding from her private parts shortly after the respondent had taken the child out of the house.; Medical examination conducted by Dr. Harpal Kaur revealed multiple injuries inside the vagina, including tears in the hymen and posterior fourchette, indicating forceful penetration by a hard object, possibly a human finger or male organ.; The doctor opined that the injuries constituted an 'attempt to rape'.; The respondent was initially charged under Section 376 (Rape) read with Section 511 (Attempt) IPC, but the Sessions Judge altered the charge to Section 354 IPC (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty).; The Sessions Judge convicted the respondent under Section 354 IPC and sentenced him to two years' rigorous imprisonment.; On appeal, the High Court of Punjab acquitted the respondent, holding that a female infant of 7.5 months could not possess a sense of 'modesty' and therefore, her modesty could not be outraged.; The State of Punjab appealed the High Court's acquittal to the Supreme Court.; The key legal question before the Supreme Court was whether a female child of such a tender age could be considered to have 'modesty' capable of being outraged under Section 354 IPC. | IPC: Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), Section 10 (Definition of 'Man', 'Woman' - specifying 'woman' denotes a female human being of any age), Section 349 (Definition of 'Force'), Section 350 (Definition of 'Criminal Force'), Section 351 (Definition of 'Assault'), Section 375 (Discussed contextually regarding 'rape' definition), Section 376 (Rape - initial consideration/charge), Section 511 (Attempt - initial consideration/charge)",
    "completion": "{\"prosecution\": [{\"argument\": \"The respondent used criminal force on the victim, a female child, with the intention of outraging her modesty, fulfilling all elements of Section 354 IPC.
