    "prompt": "Facts: There was a faction feud in village Vemulapalli, Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh.; On March 14, 1968, around 8:00 AM, a meeting of village elders (Panchayat) was held at the house of Mantri Veerabhadrayya (PW 4) to settle disputes between the faction led by accused A-1 (Rayavarapu Punnayya) and the deceased Jagannadham.; The Panchayat failed to reach a resolution.; Immediately after the Panchayat dispersal, while the deceased was near the house of PW 4, A-1 questioned him.; An altercation ensued between A-1 and the deceased.; Accused A-1 inflicted a single blow with a spear (described as 'barchi' or 'palaka barchi') on the chest/abdomen region of the deceased.; Accused A-2 (Rayavarapu Jagannadham, son of A-1) allegedly hit the deceased on the head with a stick.; The deceased collapsed and died shortly after in a nearby lane.; Medical evidence (post-mortem report by Dr. T. Ramamohana Rao, PW 1) indicated one penetrating wound (1\"x1/2\") on the left side of the abdomen, damaging the stomach and spleen, leading to hemorrhage and shock.; The injury was described by the doctor as necessarily fatal and sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.; The Trial Court (Sessions Judge, Guntur) convicted A-1 under Section 302 IPC and sentenced him to life imprisonment. A-2 was convicted under Section 324 IPC and sentenced to 6 months RI.; On appeal, the High Court of Andhra Pradesh acquitted A-2 entirely.; The High Court altered A-1's conviction from Section 302 IPC to Section 326 IPC (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons) and reduced the sentence to 5 years RI.; The State of Andhra Pradesh appealed the High Court's decision regarding A-1 to the Supreme Court.; The primary issue before the Supreme Court was whether A-1's act constituted murder (Section 302 IPC) or culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304 Part I or II IPC) or grievous hurt (Section 326 IPC). | IPC: Section 299 (Culpable Homicide), Section 300 (Murder), Section 300 Clause Thirdly (Murder - Intention to cause bodily injury sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death), Section 302 (Punishment for Murder), Section 304 (Punishment for Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder - Part I and Part II), Section 324 (Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means - relevant for A-2 initially), Section 325 (Punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt - discussed), Section 326 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means - HC conviction for A-1)",
