    "prompt": "Facts: The respondents, Deokaran Nenshi (owner) and P.B.rapati (manager) of the Stone Lime Company's Murli Hill Quarry, were required under Regulation 3 of the Indian Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1926 (read with Section 66 of the Mines Act, 1952) to furnish annual returns for the year ending December 31, 1959.; The prescribed deadline for submitting these returns was January 21, 1960.; The respondents failed to furnish the annual returns by the due date.; A complaint was filed against the respondents by the Chief Inspector of Mines, Dhanbad, before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Sasaram, on April 12, 1961.; The complaint alleged an offence under Section 66 of the Mines Act, 1952, punishable under Section 79 of the said Act.; The respondents argued before the Magistrate that the prosecution was barred by limitation under Section 79 of the Mines Act, 1952, as the complaint was filed more than six months after the date of the alleged offence (January 21, 1960).; The Magistrate upheld the objection and dismissed the complaint as time-barred.; The State of Bihar filed an appeal against the Magistrate's order to the Patna High Court.; The High Court agreed with the Magistrate, holding that the failure to furnish the return by the due date constituted a completed offence on January 21, 1960, and was not a continuing offence. Therefore, the prosecution was barred by limitation.; The State of Bihar appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court of India. | IPC: Note: This case primarily involves provisions of the Mines Act, 1952 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (relevant sections corresponding to CrPC 1973: 468, 472). While not directly applying IPC sections, the principle of 'continuing offence' discussed is relevant to the interpretation of limitations for certain IPC offences., Mines Act, 1952: Section 66 (Duty to furnish returns), Mines Act, 1952: Section 79 (Limitation of prosecutions - prescribing a six-month limitation period from the date of the offence or from the date of knowledge of the offence by the Inspector, whichever is later), Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898: Section corresponding to Section 468 CrPC, 1973 (Bar to taking cognizance after lapse of the period of limitation), Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898: Section corresponding to Section 472 CrPC, 1973 (Continuing offence - defining how limitation applies)",
