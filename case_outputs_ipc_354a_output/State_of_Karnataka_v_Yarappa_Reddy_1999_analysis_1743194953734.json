    "prompt": "Facts: The respondent, Yarappa Reddy, was accused of murdering Venkatamma, the wife of his elder brother PW-3 (Venkataswamy Reddy).; The incident occurred during the night between 10-11-1986 and 11-11-1986 in their village (Chikkaballapur Taluk, Kolar District, Karnataka).; Motive alleged by prosecution: Disputes over the partition of joint family property, for which PW-3 had filed a civil suit against the respondent and others.; The deceased was sleeping on a cot outside her house with her children.; PW-4 (Lakshmidevamma), the 10-year-old daughter of the deceased, was sleeping nearby and was presented as an eyewitness.; PW-4 testified that she woke up hearing her mother's cries ('Ayyo') and saw the respondent hitting her mother on the head with a stone (MO-1). She claimed she identified him in the moonlight and then ran inside the house crying.; PW-3 (husband) testified that he was sleeping inside, woke up on hearing PW-4's cries, came out, and saw the respondent running away from near the scene towards his own house.; PW-3 lodged the First Information Report (FIR).; PW-1 (Dr. Nanja Reddy) conducted the post-mortem examination. He found a lacerated wound on the left side of the head and a fracture of the underlying skull bone. Cause of death was shock and hemorrhage due to head injury.; PW-1 opined the injury could be caused by the stone MO-1.; MO-1 (a blood-stained stone) was allegedly recovered from an open field near the respondent's house based on a disclosure statement made by the respondent while in police custody (Section 27, Evidence Act). PW-6 was a mahazar witness to the recovery.; The Sessions Court convicted the respondent under Section 302 IPC, relying primarily on the testimonies of PW-3 and PW-4, supported by medical evidence, recovery, and motive.; The High Court of Karnataka, on appeal by the respondent, set aside the conviction and acquitted him.; The High Court disbelieved PW-4 (child witness) citing delay in recording her statement (only after inquest), possibility of tutoring, and improbability of identification in the dark.; The High Court found PW-3's testimony unreliable due to inconsistencies and his status as an interested witness, noting he didn't initially name the accused to the doctor (PW-1).; The High Court doubted the recovery of MO-1 under Section 27, as it was recovered from an open place accessible to all.; The High Court found the motive evidence weak.; The State of Karnataka appealed the High Court's acquittal to the Supreme Court. | IPC: Section 302",
