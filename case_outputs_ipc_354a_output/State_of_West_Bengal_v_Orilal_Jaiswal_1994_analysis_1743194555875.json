    "prompt": "Facts: Neelam Jaiswal (deceased) was married to Orilal Jaiswal (Respondent No. 1) approximately 2.5 years prior to her death.; On July 20, 1985, Neelam Jaiswal died due to extensive burn injuries sustained at her matrimonial home.; The prosecution alleged that Neelam was subjected to persistent demands for dowry (including items like a fridge and TV) and consequent cruelty and ill-treatment by her husband (Orilal Jaiswal) and mother-in-law (Respondent No. 2).; Evidence primarily consisted of testimony from the deceased's father (PW1) and brother (PW2) detailing the alleged dowry demands and harassment reported to them by the deceased.; Letters allegedly written by the deceased mentioning unhappiness and ill-treatment were also part of the evidence, though their specific contents linking directly to suicidal intent were debated.; The Trial Court convicted both Orilal Jaiswal and his mother under Section 306 IPC for abetment of suicide.; The High Court of Calcutta dismissed the appeal and confirmed the convictions and sentences imposed by the Trial Court.; The respondents (Orilal Jaiswal and his mother) appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court. | IPC: Section 306 (Abetment of suicide), Section 107 (Abetment of a thing - definition relied upon for S. 306), Section 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty - Contextually relevant due to nature of allegations, though the conviction appealed was under S. 306)",
