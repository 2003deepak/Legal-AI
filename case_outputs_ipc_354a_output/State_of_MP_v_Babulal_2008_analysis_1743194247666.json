The act of inflicting a blow with a dangerous weapon like a Pharsa on a vital part of the body (head) demonstrates an intention to cause death or at least an intention to cause bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, constituting murder under Section 300 (Firstly or Thirdly).\", \"precedents\": [\"Virsa Singh v.
