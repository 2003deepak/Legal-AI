    "prompt": "Facts: The petition was filed as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by Sakshi, an NGO working on child rights and against child sexual abuse.; The petition challenged the constitutional validity and adequacy of Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, defining 'rape', particularly concerning its application to child victims.; Petitioners argued that the definition of rape under Section 375, primarily focusing on penile-vaginal penetration, was excessively narrow and failed to encompass various forms of sexual assault commonly perpetrated against children (e.g., oral sex, digital penetration, object insertion).; They contended that this narrow definition left many child victims without adequate legal protection and remedy, violating their fundamental rights under the Constitution of India.; The petition highlighted the recommendations of the Law Commission of India (specifically the 172nd Report) which suggested amendments to broaden the definition of sexual assault.; Reference was made to international instruments, particularly the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), 1989, ratified by India in 1992, which obligates the state to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse.; The petitioners sought directions from the Supreme Court to either interpret Section 375 expansively or direct the Parliament to enact comprehensive legislation addressing child sexual abuse.; The Union of India was the primary respondent, representing the State.; Judgment was delivered by the Supreme Court of India on March 26, 2004. | IPC: Section 375 (Rape) - Central focus of the challenge regarding its definition and scope., Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) - Mentioned contextually as an existing provision sometimes used, but deemed inadequate by petitioners for severe child sexual assault., Section 377 (Unnatural offences) - Potentially relevant for certain acts not covered by Sec 375, but also considered inadequate and problematic in its framing.",
