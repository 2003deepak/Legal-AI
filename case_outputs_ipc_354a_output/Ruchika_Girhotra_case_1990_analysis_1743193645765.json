Singh in 1990 indicted Rathore, but no immediate formal action (FIR) was taken.; On December 28, 1993, Ruchika Girhotra consumed poison.; Ruchika died on December 29, 1993.; The suicide was linked by her family and supporters to the trauma of the molestation and the subsequent persistent harassment, particularly the targeting of her brother Ashu.; A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed by the Prakash family in the Punjab and Haryana High Court.; The High Court transferred the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2000.; CBI filed charges against Rathore, initially including Section 306 IPC (Abetment of suicide).; Trial commenced, charges were later framed primarily under Section 354 IPC (Molestation). Charges under Section 306 IPC were dropped by the trial court.; On December 21, 2009, the CBI Special Court in Chandigarh convicted S.P.S. Rathore under Section 354 IPC and sentenced him to 6 months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000.; On May 25, 2010, the Chandigarh Sessions Court upheld the conviction and enhanced the sentence to 18 months (1.5 years) rigorous imprisonment.; Rathore appealed to the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which upheld the conviction but granted bail.; The Supreme Court of India heard appeals from both Rathore (against conviction/sentence) and CBI/Prakash family (seeking conviction under Section 306 IPC and enhancement/confirmation of sentence).; On September 23, 2016, the Supreme Court upheld Rathore's conviction under Section 354 IPC but reduced the sentence to the period already undergone (around 6 months), citing his advanced age and the protracted nature of the litigation. | IPC: Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) - Convicted, Section 306 (Abetment of suicide) - Charged by CBI, dropped by Trial Court, appeal for inclusion dismissed by SC, Section 120B (Criminal Conspiracy) - Discussed in relation to harassment, but no specific conviction, Section 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) - Potentially relevant to harassment campaign, but primary focus was Rathore's individual act for 354, Section 193 (Punishment for false evidence) - Discussed regarding false cases against Ashu, but no direct charge against Rathore pursued to conviction, Section 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) - Potentially relevant to alleged cover-ups/manipulation of inquiries, Section 342 (Punishment for wrongful confinement) - Relevant to Ashu's alleged illegal detentions",
