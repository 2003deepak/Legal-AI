The court doubted the authenticity and reliability of the dying declaration and the interpretation of the letters.; The State of West Bengal appealed the acquittal to the Calcutta High Court.; The High Court reversed the Trial Court's judgment, convicted all three accused under Section 306 read with Section 34 IPC, and sentenced each to five years' rigorous imprisonment.; The High Court primarily relied on the dying declaration and the letters as proof of cruelty leading to suicide.; The accused (Orilal Jaiswal and others) filed an appeal against the High Court's conviction in the Supreme Court. | IPC: Section 306 (Abetment of suicide), Section 107 (Abetment of a thing), Section 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention)",
