    "prompt": "Facts: Marriage between Aruna (deceased) and Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (Respondent No. 1/Accused No. 1) took place on June 21, 1987.; Aruna died due to extensive burn injuries on July 1, 1987, merely 10 days after her marriage, at her matrimonial home in Bhusawal.; On July 1, 1987, around 8:30 AM, Aruna was found with 100% burn injuries in the bathroom.; She was taken to the Central Railway Hospital, Bhusawal.; First Dying Declaration (Ex. 26) was recorded by Head Constable D.K. Patil (PW 10) around 10:30 AM, stating her saree accidentally caught fire from a stove while preparing tea. A medical officer certified her fitness for the statement.; Second Dying Declaration (Ex. 33) was recorded by Special Judicial Magistrate, R.K. Kulkarni (PW 13) around 12:30 PM. In this, Aruna stated her husband (Chandraprakash) poured kerosene on her and set her ablaze because she refused his demand to write a letter to her parents asking for Rs. 50,000 for his business. A medical officer again certified her fitness.; Aruna succumbed to her injuries later the same day.; Post-mortem report indicated death due to shock from 100% burns, consistent with kerosene burns.; The accused were Chandraprakash (husband, A1), Kewalchand (father-in-law, A2), Kantabai (mother-in-law, A3), and Sharadchand (brother-in-law, A4).; Letters written by Aruna to her parents shortly after marriage (Ex. 16, 17, 18) indicated she was happy.; Testimony of Aruna's father (PW 1) and mother (PW 5) mentioned demands related to marriage expenses made *before* the wedding, but no complaints of harassment or demand received from Aruna *after* the marriage until the incident.; The Trial Court acquitted all four accused, disbelieving the second dying declaration and accepting the first (accident theory). It found no evidence of cruelty or dowry demand soon before death.; The High Court, on appeal by the State, reversed the Trial Court's judgment. It convicted Chandraprakash (husband) under Section 302 IPC (life imprisonment) and Section 498A IPC (2 years RI). It upheld the acquittal of the other three relatives (A2, A3, A4). The HC found the second dying declaration reliable and the first unreliable.; Appeals were filed in the Supreme Court: one by the State against the acquittal of A2, A3, A4, and another by Chandraprakash (A1) against his conviction. | IPC: Section 302 (Murder), Section 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Section 304B (Dowry Death - Discussed contextually), Section 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention)",
