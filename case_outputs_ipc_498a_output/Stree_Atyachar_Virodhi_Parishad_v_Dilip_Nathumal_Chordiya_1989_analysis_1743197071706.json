    "prompt": "Facts: The Stree Atyachar Virodhi Parishad (Appellant), a registered public society dedicated to assisting women subjected to atrocities, filed a criminal complaint.; The complaint was filed before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Pune, against Dilip Nathumal Chordiya (Respondent No. 1), his parents (Respondents Nos. 2 & 3), his married sister (Respondent No. 4), and his distant relatives (uncle and cousins - Respondents Nos. 5, 6, & 7).; The complaint alleged that Chanda, wife of Dilip Chordiya, was subjected to physical and mental torture by the respondents due to dissatisfaction with dowry.; Specific allegations included demands for Rs. 50,000, beatings, starvation, and threats, leading Chanda to leave the matrimonial home and stay with her parents.; The Magistrate took cognizance of the complaint and issued process against all accused under Section 498A IPC.; The Respondents filed an application under Section 482 CrPC before the Bombay High Court seeking to quash the proceedings.; The High Court quashed the proceedings on two main grounds: (i) The Appellant Parishad, being a third party, had no *locus standi* to file the complaint under Section 498A IPC, as Section 198A CrPC specifies who can complain for this offense. (ii) The allegations against the distant relatives (Respondents 4-7) were vague and did not constitute an offense under Section 498A IPC, as they were not 'relatives' within the meaning intended by the section.; The Stree Atyachar Virodhi Parishad appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court.; The victim, Chanda, also filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court supporting the Parishad's complaint and confirming the allegations.; The State of Maharashtra supported the Appellant Parishad's stance. | IPC: Section 498A",
