    "prompt": "Facts: Reema Aggarwal (Appellant) married Anupam (Respondent No. 1) on June 27, 1996, according to Hindu rites.; Prior to this marriage, Anupam was already married to Roopa, and this first marriage was subsisting.; Reema alleged that she was unaware of Anupam's first marriage at the time of her marriage.; Reema alleged that soon after the marriage, she was subjected to physical and mental torture, harassment, and cruelty by Anupam and his relatives (Respondents No. 2 to 5) over demands for dowry.; Reema filed a complaint alleging offenses under Sections 498A, 323, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).; The Respondents filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) before the High Court seeking quashing of the FIR and consequent proceedings.; The High Court quashed the proceedings, primarily on the ground that the marriage between Reema and Anupam was null and void due to Anupam's existing first marriage, and therefore, Anupam could not be considered Reema's 'husband' within the meaning of Section 498A IPC.; Reema Aggarwal appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court of India. | IPC: Section 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Section 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), Section 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation), Section 494 (Marrying again during lifetime of husband or wife - Contextually relevant for determining void marriage status), Section 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention - Likely invoked for relatives)",
