    "prompt": "Facts: Writ Petition (Civil) No. 73 of 2015 filed by Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar and another under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.; The petition challenged the perceived dilution and potential undermining of Section 498A IPC due to directions issued by the Supreme Court in Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P. (2018) 10 SCC 472.; The Rajesh Sharma judgment (July 27, 2017) issued several directions aimed at preventing the alleged misuse of Section 498A.; Key directions in Rajesh Sharma included: Establishment of Family Welfare Committees (FWCs) in each district; complaints under Section 498A to be referred to the FWC before further action/arrest; interaction with the accused/complainant by the FWC; report submission by FWC to the Magistrate; restrictions on arrest (generally no arrest before FWC report, especially of outstation relatives/elderly); provision for personal appearance exemption for accused; clubbing of cases.; Petitioners argued these directions were effectively creating new procedures not envisaged by the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) or the IPC, thereby obstructing justice for victims of cruelty.; The petitioners sought modification/recall of the directions issued in Rajesh Sharma.; The Supreme Court, in this case (Social Action Forum), reviewed the directions issued in Rajesh Sharma.; The Court heard arguments regarding the legislative intent behind Section 498A, the documented misuse of the provision, and the applicability of existing safeguards under the CrPC (like Section 41 and 41A).; The judgment was delivered on September 14, 2018 by a three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud. | IPC: Section 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty)",
