    "prompt": "Facts: Tapati Bag (Wife/Complainant) filed a criminal complaint against her husband, Patipaban Ghosh (Accused/Petitioner), and potentially other relatives.; The complaint alleged offences primarily related to matrimonial cruelty and misappropriation of property.; Specific allegations likely included demands for dowry, physical and mental torture constituting cruelty under Section 498A IPC.; Allegations also included entrustment of 'stridhan' (dowry articles and personal property of the wife) to the husband and/or his family, and their subsequent refusal to return these items upon demand, constituting criminal breach of trust under Section 406 IPC.; The complaint was likely filed before a Magistrate, who may have taken cognizance and issued process.; Patipaban Ghosh (and potentially others accused) filed a petition before the Calcutta High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) seeking to quash the criminal proceedings initiated against them.; The High Court petition likely argued that the complaint did not disclose a prima facie case, was motivated by malice, constituted an abuse of the process of court, or that the dispute was essentially civil in nature.; This case represents the judgment of the Calcutta High Court on the petition to quash the proceedings. | IPC: Section 498A IPC (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Section 406 IPC (Punishment for criminal breach of trust), Section 34 IPC (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) - Potentially involved if multiple accused acted together., Section 482 CrPC (Inherent powers of High Court) - While not an IPC section, it is the procedural provision under which the High Court petition was filed and decided.",
