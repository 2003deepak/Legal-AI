    "prompt": "Facts: The appellant, Ratilal Bhanji Muthani, was apprehended by Customs Officers near Bassein Creek.; Upon searching the appellant, a specially tailored jacket containing 25 slabs of gold was found concealed underneath his regular clothes.; The gold weighed approximately 2497.900 grams.; The gold was seized under a panchnama.; The appellant was charged with offences under the Defence of India Rules, 1971 (DIR) and the Customs Act, 1962.; Specifically, charges were framed under Rule 126-H(2)(d) read with Rule 126-P(2)(ii) of the DIR and Section 135(1)(a) of the Customs Act, 1962.; The Trial Court convicted the appellant under both statutory provisions.; The High Court of Bombay upheld the conviction on appeal.; The appellant subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court, primarily challenging the conviction on the ground that the prosecution failed to prove 'mens rea' (guilty knowledge) beyond reasonable doubt.; The core factual element relied upon by the prosecution was the discovery of gold concealed on the appellant's person in a specially made jacket. | IPC: Note: This case primarily involves offences under the Customs Act, 1962 and the Defence of India Rules, 1971, not the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
