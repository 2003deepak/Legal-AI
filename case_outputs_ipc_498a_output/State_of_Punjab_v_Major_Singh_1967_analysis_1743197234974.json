    "prompt": "Facts: The respondent, Major Singh, was accused of committing an act against a female child.; The victim was aged 7 and a half months at the time of the incident.; The accused allegedly inserted his penis into the vagina of the child.; The act caused injuries to the child, specifically a rupture of the hymen resulting in bleeding.; The child cried out, alerting the mother who discovered the bleeding.; Medical examination confirmed the injury to the child's private parts.; The Sessions Judge convicted the respondent under Section 376, IPC (Rape).; The High Court, on appeal, acquitted the respondent of rape under Section 376 but convicted him under Section 354, IPC (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty).; The State of Punjab appealed to the Supreme Court against the acquittal under Section 376.; The respondent (Major Singh) did not appeal against his conviction under Section 354.; The Supreme Court primarily dealt with the interpretation of 'penetration' under Section 375 and the meaning of 'modesty' under Section 354 in the context of a very young child. | IPC: Section 375 (Rape - Definition), Section 376 (Punishment for Rape), Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty)",
    "completion": "{\"prosecution\": [{\"argument\": \"The act constituted rape under Section 375/376 IPC as there was sufficient penetration, however slight, evidenced by the medical report showing injury (ruptured hymen).\", \"precedents\": [\"R. v.
