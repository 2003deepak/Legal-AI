    "prompt": "Facts: The appellant, Shivcharan Lal Verma, was originally tried for an offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).; The trial court convicted the appellant, but the specific section of conviction by the trial court is not detailed in the 2007 Supreme Court judgment.; On appeal, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh altered the conviction from the original charge (presumably Section 302 IPC or similar) to one under Section 304 Part II of the IPC.; The High Court sentenced the appellant to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a term of five years.; The appellant filed an appeal before the Supreme Court of India challenging the High Court's judgment.; During the pendency of the appeal in the Supreme Court, a compromise was reached between the appellant and the legal heirs (specifically the son and widow) of the deceased.; An application was filed in the Supreme Court seeking permission to compound the offence based on this compromise.; The appellant had already undergone a period of imprisonment (approximately four months as noted in the judgment).; The key issue before the Supreme Court in this specific (2007) judgment was the effect of the compromise on the conviction and sentence under Section 304 Part II IPC. | IPC: Section 302 (Original charge, context), Section 304 Part II (Section under which conviction was upheld by High Court and considered by Supreme Court)",
