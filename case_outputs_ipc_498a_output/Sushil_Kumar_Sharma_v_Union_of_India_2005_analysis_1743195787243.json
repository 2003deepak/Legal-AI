    "prompt": "Facts: The petitioner, Sushil Kumar Sharma, filed a Writ Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.; The petition challenged the constitutional validity of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.; The primary grounds for the challenge were that Section 498A violated Articles 14 (Equality before law) and 21 (Protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.; The petitioner argued that the section was vague, overly broad, conferred arbitrary power on police and courts, and was being widely misused by disgruntled wives and their families to harass husbands and their relatives.; The petitioner contended that the term 'cruelty' as defined in the explanation to Section 498A was ambiguous and susceptible to subjective interpretation.; It was argued that the provision led to automatic arrest of the husband and his relatives upon lodging of a complaint, often without adequate investigation, causing immense social stigma and hardship.; The petitioner highlighted instances where the provision was allegedly used as a tool for blackmail and extortion.; The Union of India (Respondent) defended the constitutionality of the provision, emphasizing its objective to protect women from cruelty and harassment related to dowry demands within the matrimonial home. | IPC: Section 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Note: While the petition arose likely from a specific case involving S.498A against the petitioner, the judgment primarily deals with the constitutional challenge to the section itself, not the factual merits of an underlying criminal case. Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India are central to the legal analysis.",
