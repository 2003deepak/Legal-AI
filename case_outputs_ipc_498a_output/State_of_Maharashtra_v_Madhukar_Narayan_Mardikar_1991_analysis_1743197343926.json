    "prompt": "Facts: The respondent, Madhukar Narayan Mardikar, was serving as a Police Constable in the State of Maharashtra.; On the night of November 11, 1965, around 1:00 AM, while officially on sick leave, the respondent allegedly went to the hutment of Banubi, wife of Usmankhan.; It was alleged that the respondent was intoxicated, in a semi-nude state (wearing only an underwear), and attempted to force entry into Banubi's hut by knocking violently.; Banubi was alleged by the respondent (and assumed by the High Court) to be a woman of 'easy virtue' or a prostitute, although this was contested and deemed irrelevant by the Supreme Court.; A departmental enquiry was initiated against the respondent based on these allegations.; A charge-sheet was served upon the respondent on January 21, 1966, for conduct unbecoming of a police officer under the relevant police service rules (specific rule not detailed in SC judgment summary, but implied to be related to discipline and conduct).; The Enquiry Officer found the charges to be proved based on evidence presented, including Banubi's testimony.; Following the enquiry report, the Superintendent of Police, Amravati, passed an order dismissing the respondent from service on July 1, 1966.; The respondent's departmental appeals to the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Nagpur Range, and subsequently to the State Government were dismissed.; The respondent filed a Writ Petition before the High Court of Bombay (Nagpur Bench).; On March 12, 1976, the High Court allowed the Writ Petition and quashed the dismissal order.; The High Court reasoned that the alleged incident occurred during the respondent's private life, did not pertain to his official duties, and was protected by the right to privacy. It held that visiting a prostitute (assuming Banubi was one) was not the concern of the department.; The State of Maharashtra appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court. | IPC: Not Applicable - The case involves disciplinary proceedings under Police Service Rules for conduct unbecoming of a police officer, not criminal prosecution under the Indian Penal Code. While the alleged acts (e.g., trespass, public nuisance) might potentially overlap with IPC offenses, no IPC charges were framed or adjudicated in this specific legal context.",
    "completion": "{\"prosecution\": [{\"argument\": \"The High Court erred in quashing the dismissal order by incorrectly applying the right to privacy.

State of M.P. (1975) 2 SCC 148 (Acknowledged right to privacy but subject to reasonable restrictions, especially for public order/morality - State argued respondent's conduct fell outside protected zone).\", \"S.
