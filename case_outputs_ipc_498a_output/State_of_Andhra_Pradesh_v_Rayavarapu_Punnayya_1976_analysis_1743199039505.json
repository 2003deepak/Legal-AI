    "prompt": "Facts: A dispute arose concerning the flow of irrigation water from a channel ('Bodhi').; Accused No. 1 (A-1, Rayavarapu Punnayya) allegedly diverted water, obstructing flow to the fields of Prosecution Witness 1 (PW-1) and the deceased (Jagannadham).; On the morning of July 14, 1968, the deceased questioned A-1 about the obstruction, leading to a verbal altercation.; Subsequently, A-1, along with Accused Nos. 2 to 5 (A-2 to A-5), arrived armed with stout bamboo sticks ('lathis' or 'geddas').; The accused collectively attacked the deceased.; Medical evidence indicated the deceased sustained 19 injuries, including serious head injuries (fractures) inflicted by blunt weapons (consistent with lathis).; The deceased succumbed to his injuries ten days later, on July 24, 1968, in the hospital.; The Trial Court convicted all five accused under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC (Murder committed in furtherance of common intention) and sentenced them to life imprisonment.; The High Court of Andhra Pradesh, on appeal, altered the conviction to Section 304 Part II read with Section 34 IPC (Culpable homicide not amounting to murder, committed with knowledge but without intention, in furtherance of common intention), reducing the sentence to rigorous imprisonment for five years.; The State of Andhra Pradesh appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court's decision, seeking restoration of the Trial Court's conviction under Section 302 IPC. | IPC: Section 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), Section 299 (Culpable Homicide), Section 300 (Murder), Section 302 (Punishment for Murder), Section 304 Part I (Punishment for Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder - with intention), Section 304 Part II (Punishment for Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder - with knowledge)",
    "completion": "{\"prosecution\": [{\"argument\": \"The High Court erred in altering the conviction from Section 302 to Section 304 Part II IPC. The nature, number, and location of injuries inflicted (19 injuries, including severe head injuries) with dangerous weapons (stout lathis) establish an intention to cause bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, bringing the act squarely within the definition of murder under Section 300, Clause 3rdly.\", \"precedents\": [\"Virsa Singh v.

There was no intention to cause death or such bodily injury as is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
