    "prompt": "Facts: The petition was filed as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by Sakshi, an NGO working on child rights and prevention of child sexual abuse, along with other concerned parties.; The petition challenged the constitutional validity and adequacy of the definition of 'rape' under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860.; Petitioners argued that the definition was overly narrow as it only recognized penile-vaginal penetration as constituting rape.; It was contended that this definition failed to adequately protect victims, particularly children, from other forms of penetrative sexual assault, such as oral, anal, digital, or object penetration.; The petition highlighted the trauma faced by child victims during investigation and trial under the existing criminal justice procedures.; Relief sought included broadening the definition of rape under Section 375 IPC to include all forms of penetration and seeking directions for procedural reforms to make the trial process more sensitive to child victims.; The Law Commission of India's 172nd Report on 'Review of Rape Laws' (submitted in March 2000), which recommended significant changes to the definition of rape and trial procedures, was brought to the Court's attention and heavily relied upon.; The Union of India was the primary respondent, representing the legislative and executive branches responsible for enacting and amending laws. | IPC: Section 375 (Rape - Definition under challenge), Section 376 (Punishment for Rape - Consequential to Section 375), Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty - Discussed as alternative inadequate charge), Section 377 (Unnatural offences - Discussed as inadequate for certain forms of abuse)",
