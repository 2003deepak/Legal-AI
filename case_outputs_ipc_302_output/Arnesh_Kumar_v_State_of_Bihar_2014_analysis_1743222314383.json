    "prompt": "Facts: Marriage between Arnesh Kumar (Appellant) and Sweta Kiran (Respondent No. 2) solemnized on July 1, 2007.; Sweta Kiran alleged demands for dowry (Rs. 8 lakhs, a Maruti car, an air-conditioner, a television set etc.) soon after marriage.; Allegations of cruelty and harassment against the husband (Arnesh Kumar), mother-in-law, father-in-law, and other relatives.; Sweta Kiran was allegedly driven out of the matrimonial home due to non-fulfillment of dowry demands.; FIR No. 95 of 2012 was registered on behalf of Sweta Kiran under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.; Arnesh Kumar apprehended arrest based on the FIR.; Arnesh Kumar filed an application for anticipatory bail (under Section 438 CrPC) before the Sessions Judge, Patna, which was rejected.; Arnesh Kumar then filed an application for anticipatory bail before the High Court of Patna, which was also dismissed by order dated November 13, 2013.; Arnesh Kumar filed a Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court of India against the High Court's order, challenging the denial of anticipatory bail and highlighting the routine nature of arrests under Section 498A IPC.; The core issue before the Supreme Court was the interpretation and application of Section 41 and Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC) concerning the power of police to arrest, particularly in cases involving offences punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be less than seven years or which may extend to seven years, with or without fine, like Section 498A IPC. | IPC: Section 498A IPC (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (Penalty for demanding dowry), Note: The judgment extensively discusses and interprets Section 41 and Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which govern police powers of arrest.",
