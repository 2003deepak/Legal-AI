    "prompt": "Facts: The case involved an appeal by the State of Andhra Pradesh against the High Court's acquittal of the respondents (originally accused A-1 and A-2) for the charge under Section 302 IPC.; The incident occurred on February 14, 1969, around 8:00 AM in village Koppurru.; There was prior enmity between the deceased (Jagannadham) and the accused party.; On the day of the incident, the deceased was proceeding from his village towards the field of one K. Ramayya (PW 5).; Accused A-1 (Rayavarapu Punnayya) and A-2 (Rayavarapu Peda Punnayya), along with three others (A-3 to A-5, who were acquitted by the Trial Court and whose acquittal was not challenged), waylaid the deceased.; The accused were armed with sticks (variously described, but essentially lathis).; A-1 and A-2 confronted the deceased regarding a prior incident involving PW 5.; Following a brief altercation, A-1 and A-2 beat the deceased with their sticks.; Multiple injuries were inflicted on the deceased, primarily on the legs and arms, but also vital areas including the head.; Medical evidence (post-mortem report by Dr. K. Ramachandra Rao, PW 1) showed 20 injuries, including contusions, abrasions, and notably, fractures of the skull bones (temporal and parietal) leading to subdural hemorrhage.; The doctor opined that the head injuries (specifically Injury No. 19 - fracture of left temporal and parietal bones) were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.; The deceased succumbed to his injuries later the same day at around 5:00 PM in the hospital.; The Trial Court (Sessions Judge, Guntur) convicted A-1 and A-2 under Section 304 Part I read with Section 34 IPC, sentencing them to 5 years rigorous imprisonment.; The High Court of Andhra Pradesh, on appeal by the accused, acquitted them of the charge under Section 304 Part I/34 IPC, but convicted them under Section 325 read with Section 34 IPC (grievous hurt), reducing the sentence to 3 years rigorous imprisonment.; The State of Andhra Pradesh appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court's decision, arguing for conviction under Section 302/34 IPC.; The Supreme Court noted the High Court erroneously focused only on the intention to cause death, neglecting the possibility of intention to cause injuries sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death (Clause 3 of Section 300). | IPC: Section 34 (Common Intention), Section 299 (Culpable Homicide), Section 300 (Murder), Section 302 (Punishment for Murder), Section 304 Part I (Punishment for Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder - with intention to cause death or bodily injury likely to cause death), Section 304 Part II (Punishment for Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder - with knowledge that the act is likely to cause death), Section 325 (Punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt)",
