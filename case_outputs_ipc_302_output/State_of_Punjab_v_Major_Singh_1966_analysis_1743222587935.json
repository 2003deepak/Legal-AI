    "prompt": "Facts: The respondent, Major Singh, was accused of committing an offense under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code.; The victim was a female child aged 7 and a half months.; The specific act involved the respondent causing injuries to the victim's vagina, including rupture of the hymen, indicating some form of penetration.; The incident occurred on March 13, 1962, in the evening.; Medical examination by Dr. R. L. Bhandari confirmed the injuries (vaginal tear, hymenal rupture, bleeding).; The Sessions Judge convicted Major Singh under Section 354 IPC.; The High Court of Punjab acquitted Major Singh on appeal, reasoning that a female child of 7.5 months could not possess a 'sense of modesty' and therefore, her modesty could not be outraged.; The State of Punjab filed an appeal against the High Court's acquittal to the Supreme Court of India. | IPC: Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), Section 10 (Definition of 'Man', 'Woman' - clarifying 'Woman' denotes a female human being of any age), Section 319 (Definition of Hurt - relevant to alternative view considered), Section 351 (Definition of Assault - relevant to S. 354), Section 350 (Definition of Criminal Force - relevant to S. 354)",
    "completion": "{\"prosecution\": [{\"argument\": \"The accused committed an act falling under Section 354 IPC by using criminal force (penetration/injury) on a female child with the knowledge that the act was likely to outrage her modesty.\", \"precedents\": [\"Section 10 IPC (Statutory definition establishing 'woman' includes a female of any age)\", \"R. v. Timmins (1846) Le & Cave 506 (English case discussed regarding indecent assault on young children, indicating protection regardless of age/consent)\", \"Ramkripal S/O Shyam Lal Charmakar v. State of Madhya Pradesh (2007) 11 SCC 265 (Later case affirming the principle laid down in Major Singh)\"]}], \"defense\": [{\"argument\": \"The offense under Section 354 IPC requires the victim to have a developed sense of modesty capable of being outraged. An infant of 7.5 months lacks this attribute, so the essential ingredient of the offense is missing. The act, while potentially constituting hurt or simple assault, does not fit Section 354.\", \"precedents\": [\"High Court Judgment in State of Punjab v. Major Singh (Source of the acquittal, based on the reasoning that an infant lacks modesty)\", \"Insufficient data (Prior authoritative precedents supporting this specific interpretation for infants under S.354 were not established or cited extensively; the High Court view was novel/contentious)\", \"Insufficient data\"]}]}"
