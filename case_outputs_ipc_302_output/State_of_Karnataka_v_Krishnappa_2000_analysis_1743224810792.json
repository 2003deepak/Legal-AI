    "prompt": "Facts: The deceased, Manjula, was married to Krishnappa (Respondent) on 20.04.1989.; Manjula died by suicide (hanging) in her matrimonial home on 21.07.1990, within 1 year and 3 months of marriage.; Prior to her death, Manjula had written letters (Exhibits P-8, P-9, P-10) to her parents detailing harassment and demands for dowry (money, gold chain) by her husband and mother-in-law.; The letters indicated threats and physical/mental cruelty inflicted upon her.; Specifically, Exhibit P-10, written shortly before her death, mentioned intense pressure for money to buy land and threats if the demand was not met.; The father of the deceased (PW-1) testified about the dowry demands made before and after the marriage, and the cruelty reported by his daughter.; The Trial Court convicted the respondent (Krishnappa) under Sections 304B and 498A IPC, sentencing him to 7 years and 2 years RI respectively, to run concurrently.; The High Court acquitted the respondent, primarily reasoning that the alleged harassment was not proximate enough to the death to satisfy the 'soon before death' requirement of Section 304B, and that the demands were ordinary requests.; The State of Karnataka appealed the High Court's acquittal to the Supreme Court. | IPC: Section 304B (Dowry Death), Section 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Section 306 (Abetment of suicide - Discussed contextually), Section 113B, Indian Evidence Act (Presumption as to dowry death)",
