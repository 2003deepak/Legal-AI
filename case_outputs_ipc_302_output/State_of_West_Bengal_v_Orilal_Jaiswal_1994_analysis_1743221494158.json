Kuldip Kaur married Orilal Jaiswal (Respondent No. 1) on April 19, 1981.; Respondents No. 2 and 3 were the father-in-law and mother-in-law of the deceased.; Allegations arose that the deceased was subjected to continuous torture and harassment by her husband and in-laws for not meeting dowry demands (including a scooter, fridge, and TV).; The deceased communicated her suffering and the demands to her parents (PW1, PW2) and brother (PW4) through letters and conversations.; Around 1984, the deceased allegedly attempted suicide by consuming 'Tik Twenty' poison but was saved.; On June 16, 1985, Smt. Kuldip Kaur died as a result of burn injuries sustained after setting herself on fire at her matrimonial home.; A dying declaration was purportedly recorded, but its validity/contents were contested or not fully relied upon in the final judgment.; The prosecution case, based primarily on the testimony of the deceased's relatives (PW1, PW2, PW4) and letters, alleged that the persistent cruelty and harassment drove her to commit suicide.; The Trial Court convicted all three accused under Section 306 IPC. Orilal Jaiswal was sentenced to 5 years Rigorous Imprisonment (RI), and the parents-in-law were sentenced to 2 years RI each.; The High Court upheld the conviction and sentences passed by the Trial Court.; The accused appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court. | IPC: Section 306 (Abetment of suicide), Section 107 (Abetment - Definition, as prerequisite for S. 306), Section 498A (Cruelty by husband or relatives of husband - Discussed contextually, though conviction was under S. 306), Section 113A, Indian Evidence Act (Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a married woman - Discussed extensively)",
