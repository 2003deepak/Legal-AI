    "prompt": "Facts: The case pertains to a series of murders committed on the intervening night of August 12/13, 1977, in a village in Punjab.; The appellants (Machhi Singh and others) were involved in a long-standing feud with the family of Amar Singh and Mohinder Singh.; A prior incident had led to the conviction and sentencing of close relatives of Machhi Singh.; Seeking revenge, Machhi Singh and his companions launched a pre-planned attack on the households connected to Amar Singh and Mohinder Singh.; During the night, the assailants systematically attacked five different dwelling houses.; A total of seventeen persons (men, women, and children) were killed during these attacks.; The attacks were carried out with firearms and possibly other weapons.; Survivors of the attacks acted as eyewitnesses and identified the assailants.; The Sessions Court convicted the appellants under Sections 302 read with Section 149, and Section 148 of the IPC.; The Sessions Court sentenced Machhi Singh and several other principal accused to death, while others received life imprisonment.; The High Court of Punjab and Haryana confirmed the death sentences for the appellants.; The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court challenging their convictions and, more significantly, the imposition of the death penalty. | IPC: Section 302 (Punishment for Murder), Section 149 (Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), Section 148 (Rioting, armed with deadly weapon), Section 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention - discussed in principle though conviction was primarily under S.149)",
    "completion": "{\"prosecution\": [{\"argument\": \"The appellants, forming an unlawful assembly with the common object of committing murder as revenge, attacked multiple homes and intentionally caused the deaths of seventeen people. Their conviction under Sections 302/149 and 148 IPC is fully supported by eyewitness testimony.\", \"precedents\": [\"Masalti v. State of U.P. (AIR 1965 SC 202) - On liability under Sec 149 in mass attacks.\", \"Lalji v. State of U.P. (1989) 1 SCC 437 - On establishing common object of unlawful assembly.\", \"Vadivelu Thevar v. State of Madras (AIR 1957 SC 614) - On reliability of eyewitness testimony.\"]}, {\"argument\": \"The crime committed by the appellants was exceptionally heinous, brutal, and involved a large-scale massacre of innocent and defenseless people, including women and children, driven by a motive of vendetta. This qualifies as the 'rarest of rare' cases, justifying the imposition of the death penalty.\", \"precedents\": [\"Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (AIR 1980 SC 898) - Established the 'rarest of rare' doctrine for death penalty, requiring consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\", \"Jagmohan Singh v. State of U.P. (AIR 1973 SC 947) - Upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty prior to Bachan Singh.\", \"Ediga Anamma v. State of A.P. (AIR 1974 SC 799) - Discussed factors for sentencing discretion between death and life imprisonment (pre-Bachan Singh guidelines).\"]}], \"defense\": [{\"argument\": \"The prosecution evidence, particularly eyewitness identification, is unreliable due to the circumstances (night attack, potential bias from feud). The conviction itself is flawed.\", \"precedents\": [\"Kanan v. State of Kerala (AIR 1979 SC 1127) - Identification by single witness at night requires caution.\", \"Wakil Singh v. State of Bihar (AIR 1981 SC 1392) - Need for careful scrutiny of evidence in factional disputes.\", \"State of Rajasthan v. Kalki (AIR 1981 SC 1390) - Corroboration sought for interested witnesses.\"]}, {\"argument\": \"Even if the conviction is upheld, the case does not fall into the 'rarest of rare' category as defined in Bachan Singh. Mitigating factors exist, and life imprisonment would serve the ends of justice. The High Court erred in confirming the death sentence.\", \"precedents\": [\"Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (AIR 1980 SC 898) - Death penalty only when life imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed.\", \"Munna v. State (Union of India) (AIR 2005 SC 3909) - Life imprisonment awarded in multiple murders considering circumstances.\", \"Panchhi v. State of U.P. (1998) 7 SCC 177) - Death sentence commuted in a triple murder case considering background and motive.\"]}]}"
