    "prompt": "Facts: Bachan Singh was tried and convicted for the murders of Desa Singh, Durga Bai, and Veeran Bai.; The Sessions Judge awarded Bachan Singh the death sentence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).; The sentence was confirmed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.; Bachan Singh appealed to the Supreme Court by special leave.; The core issue before the Supreme Court's Constitution Bench was the constitutional validity of the death penalty provided under Section 302 IPC.; The challenge was primarily based on alleged violations of Article 19 (Fundamental Freedoms) and Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) of the Constitution of India.; Arguments also touched upon Article 14 (Equality before Law) concerning the discretionary power vested in courts.; The case required examination of the sentencing procedure under Section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973, which mandates giving 'special reasons' for imposing the death penalty.; Previous Supreme Court rulings like Jagmohan Singh v. State of U.P. (1973) and Rajendra Prasad v. State of U.P. (1979) had differing perspectives on the death penalty, necessitating a larger bench review. | IPC: Section 302 (Punishment for Murder)",
