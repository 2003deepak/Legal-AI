    "prompt": "Facts: The case involves an appeal by the State of Gujarat against the acquittal of the respondents (Anirudhsing and potentially others, specific relationship to the deceased not detailed in summary) by the High Court.; The respondents were initially tried and convicted by the Sessions Court under Sections 498A and 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).; The deceased, wife of one of the respondents (details inferred, likely Anirudhsing), died by suicide.; The prosecution alleged that the deceased was subjected to cruelty and harassment by the respondents in connection with demands for dowry, which led her to commit suicide.; Evidence presented likely included testimonies of the deceased's relatives (parents/siblings) regarding the alleged cruelty and demands.; Medical evidence (post-mortem report) would have confirmed the cause of death as suicide.; The specific nature and timing of the alleged cruelty and demands, and the timeframe between the last alleged act of cruelty and the suicide, were key factual elements under consideration.; The Sessions Court found the evidence sufficient to establish cruelty under Section 498A and concluded that this cruelty constituted abetment leading to the suicide under Section 306 IPC, possibly invoking the presumption under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act.; The High Court, on appeal by the accused, re-evaluated the evidence and acquitted the respondents, likely finding the evidence insufficient to prove either cruelty under 498A beyond reasonable doubt or that such cruelty directly led to or constituted abetment of suicide under Section 306.; The State of Gujarat appealed the High Court's acquittal to the Supreme Court. | IPC: Section 306 (Abetment of suicide), Section 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Section 107 (Abetment - Defines abetment used in Sec 306)",
