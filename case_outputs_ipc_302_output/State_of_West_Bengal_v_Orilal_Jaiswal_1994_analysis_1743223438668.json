    "prompt": "Facts: The deceased, Uma Jaiswal, was married to Orilal Jaiswal (Respondent No. 1) in May 1981.; Respondents No. 2 (Ayodhya Prasad Jaiswal) and No. 3 (Kalawati Devi) were the father-in-law and mother-in-law of the deceased.; Allegations surfaced that soon after marriage, the deceased was subjected to persistent demands for dowry (cash, refrigerator, television set) and consequent torture, both mental and physical, by all three respondents.; The deceased wrote letters to her father detailing the harassment and torture she faced due to unmet dowry demands.; On July 25, 1984, Uma Jaiswal died due to burn injuries sustained after setting herself on fire at her matrimonial home.; The Trial Court convicted all three respondents under Section 306 IPC (Abetment of Suicide) and sentenced them to imprisonment.; The High Court, on appeal, acquitted all three respondents, primarily finding that the evidence did not establish abetment beyond reasonable doubt and that mere harassment might not amount to instigation.; The State of West Bengal filed an appeal against the High Court's acquittal order before the Supreme Court. | IPC: Section 306, Section 107 (Abetment definition, discussed contextually), Section 498A (Discussed contextually regarding cruelty, though conviction was under 306)",
