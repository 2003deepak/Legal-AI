    "prompt": "Facts: The respondents, Deokaran Nenshi and another, were the owner and manager respectively of a stone quarry in Jamunia, Bihar.; They were required under Regulation 11 of the Indian Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1926 (read with the Mines Act, 1952) to furnish annual returns for the year ending December 31, 1959.; The statutory deadline for furnishing these returns was January 21, 1960.; The respondents failed to furnish the annual returns by the due date.; A complaint was filed against the respondents by the Inspector of Mines on May 12, 1960, before the Magistrate, First Class, Dhanbad.; The Trial Magistrate convicted the respondents on March 31, 1961, under Regulation 11 read with Section 66 of the Mines Act, 1952, imposing a fine of Rs. 200/- each.; The respondents' appeal to the Sessions Court was dismissed.; The respondents filed a revision petition before the High Court of Patna.; The High Court allowed the revision, set aside the conviction and sentence, and acquitted the respondents.; The High Court's decision was based on the interpretation of Section 79 of the Mines Act, 1952, holding that the offence was completed on January 21, 1960, and the complaint filed on May 12, 1960, was barred by the six-month limitation period.; The State of Bihar appealed the High Court's acquittal order to the Supreme Court. | IPC: None directly applied for conviction. The case primarily involved provisions of the Mines Act, 1952 and the Indian Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1926. The core legal principle analyzed was the concept of a 'continuing offence', which is relevant across criminal law, including certain IPC offences (e.g., wrongful confinement), but no specific IPC section was invoked against the accused in this matter.",
