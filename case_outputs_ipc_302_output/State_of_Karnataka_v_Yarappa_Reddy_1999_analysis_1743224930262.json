    "prompt": "Facts: The case pertains to the alleged murder of Narasimha Reddy on 24.07.1987 at about 6:30 PM near Gangasandra village.; The First Information Report (FIR) was lodged by PW-1 (Venkataswamy Reddy), the brother of the deceased, at about 8:00 PM the same day.; The FIR initially named Yarappa Reddy (respondent/accused) and three others (Papanna, Munivenkatappa, Pillavenkatappa) as assailants.; The alleged motive was a long-standing land dispute between the accused party and the deceased's family.; PW-1 claimed he heard the deceased cry out 'Ayyo! Yarappa Reddy, Papanna, Munivenkatappa and Pillavenkatappa are killing me!' from about 200 yards away.; PW-1 stated he rushed towards the scene and saw the four accused running away.; PW-2 (Ashwathappa) and PW-3 (Munivenkatappa), cousins of the deceased, claimed they were returning from their fields and saw the four accused running away from the direction of the incident.; An inquest was held (Ex.P-10), and a spot mahazar (Ex.P-11) was prepared.; Post-mortem examination (Dr. B. M. Chandrasekhar, PW-8) revealed 12 incised wounds, consistent with assault by sharp-edged weapons. Cause of death was shock and haemorrhage due to multiple injuries.; Accused Yarappa Reddy was arrested on 26.07.1987.; Based on Yarappa Reddy's alleged voluntary statement (Ex.P-14), a chopper (MO.1) was recovered from beneath thorny bushes near his Ragi field under a mahazar (Ex.P-5) attested by PW-4 (Rama Reddy) and PW-7 (Venkatesha).; The chopper (MO.1) was sent for chemical examination, but the serologist's report indicated human blood, but the origin/grouping was inconclusive.; The Trial Court (Sessions Judge, Kolar) acquitted all four accused, citing discrepancies in witness testimonies, doubt about PW-1 hearing the specific names from 200 yards, the interested nature of witnesses (PW-1, PW-2, PW-3 being relatives), lack of independent corroboration, and unconvincing recovery evidence.; The State of Karnataka appealed the acquittal to the High Court of Karnataka.; The High Court reversed the trial court's judgment, convicted Yarappa Reddy under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The acquittal of the other three accused was maintained.; The High Court found the testimonies of PW-1, PW-2, and PW-3 credible, accepted the motive, and relied on the recovery of MO.1 at the instance of Yarappa Reddy.; Yarappa Reddy filed the present appeal before the Supreme Court challenging the High Court's conviction. | IPC: Section 302 (Punishment for Murder), Section 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention)",
