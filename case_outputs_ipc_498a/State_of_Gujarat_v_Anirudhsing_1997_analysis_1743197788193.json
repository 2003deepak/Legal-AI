      "The Supreme Court emphasized that an appellate court should be slow to interfere with an acquittal, especially when the trial court's view is reasonable and plausible. Reversal is justified only if the trial court's findings are perverse or clearly erroneous.",
      "The prosecution failed to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the defense version accepted by the Trial Court could not be ruled out.",
      "Since the primary offence of murder (Sec 302) was not proven beyond reasonable doubt, the conviction under Section 201 IPC also could not be sustained."
