  "facts": [
    "Writ Petition (Civil) No. 73 of 2015 filed by Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar and another under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.",
    "The petition challenged the perceived dilution and potential undermining of Section 498A IPC due to directions issued by the Supreme Court in Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P. (2018) 10 SCC 472.",
    "The Rajesh Sharma judgment (July 27, 2017) issued several directions aimed at preventing the alleged misuse of Section 498A.",
    "Key directions in Rajesh Sharma included: Establishment of Family Welfare Committees (FWCs) in each district; complaints under Section 498A to be referred to the FWC before further action/arrest; interaction with the accused/complainant by the FWC; report submission by FWC to the Magistrate; restrictions on arrest (generally no arrest before FWC report, especially of outstation relatives/elderly); provision for personal appearance exemption for accused; clubbing of cases.",
    "Petitioners argued these directions were effectively creating new procedures not envisaged by the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) or the IPC, thereby obstructing justice for victims of cruelty.",
    "The petitioners sought modification/recall of the directions issued in Rajesh Sharma.",
    "The Supreme Court, in this case (Social Action Forum), reviewed the directions issued in Rajesh Sharma.",
    "The Court heard arguments regarding the legislative intent behind Section 498A, the documented misuse of the provision, and the applicability of existing safeguards under the CrPC (like Section 41 and 41A).",
    "The judgment was delivered on September 14, 2018 by a three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud."

      "The constitution of FWCs and referral of complaints to them before police action is not contemplated under the CrPC and amounts to creating a parallel mechanism outside the statutory framework.",

      "The guidelines laid down in Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar regarding arrest procedures under Sections 41 and 41A CrPC are comprehensive and must be strictly followed by police authorities. These provide adequate safeguards against arbitrary arrest.",
      "While acknowledging the potential misuse of Section 498A, the Court held that such misuse cannot be grounds for diluting the provision itself or creating extra-legal procedures. Remedies lie in enforcing existing safeguards (Arnesh Kumar guidelines) and potentially through legislative change if deemed necessary.",
      "Directions regarding exemption from personal appearance and clubbing of cases were retained as being procedural and within judicial discretion.",
      "The Court emphasized adherence to the procedures outlined in CrPC and the principles established in Lalita Kumari and Arnesh Kumar."
