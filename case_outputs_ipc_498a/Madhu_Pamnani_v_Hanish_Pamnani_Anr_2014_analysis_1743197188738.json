      "On territorial jurisdiction, relying on *Sunita Kumari Kashyap*, the Court held that Delhi courts have jurisdiction as the consequences of cruelty (wife taking shelter at parental home) ensued in Delhi, and refusal to return stridhan could constitute a continuing offence or part of the cause of action arising in Delhi.",
      "A prima facie case for entrustment and non-return of stridhan (Section 406 IPC) was found based on the complainant's allegations and list.",
      "The Court reiterated that the power under Section 482 CrPC should be exercised sparingly and not when the FIR discloses prima facie cognizable offences. Detailed evaluation of evidence is the domain of the trial court.",
      "The allegations required investigation and trial to determine veracity."
