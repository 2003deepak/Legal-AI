    "The respondent initially denied that the deceased was in his house.",
    "Later, upon insistence, the respondent admitted she was inside but refused to open the door.",
    "The parents sought help from neighbours and eventually the police (SI Amarjit Singh, PW9).",
    "The police arrived, and after repeated requests, the respondent opened the door.",
    "The deceased was found lying dead on a cot inside the respondent's house.",
    "Post-mortem examination conducted by Dr. Ajit Singh Mann (PW1) revealed:",
