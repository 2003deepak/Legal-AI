  "facts": [
    "The respondents, Deokaran Nenshi and Ramnibas Nessaria, were owners of the Pakuria Stone Quarry in the Sub-Division of Jamtara.",
    "On December 25, 1960, Shri L. Paswan, Inspector of Mines, inspected the quarry.",
    "During the inspection, it was found that the respondents had failed to furnish the half-yearly returns for the periods ending June 30, 1960, and December 31, 1960.",
    "This non-submission was alleged to be a contravention of Regulation 19(1)(b) of the Indian Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1926 (read with the Mines Act, 1952).",
    "Regulation 19(1)(b) required owners, agents, or managers of mines to submit half-yearly returns in the prescribed Form II-A on or before the 21st day of July and the 21st day of January each year.",
    "A complaint was filed by the State of Bihar against the respondents on April 12, 1961, before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Jamtara.",
    "The complaint alleged contravention of Regulation 19(1)(b) punishable under Section 66 of the Mines Act, 1952.",
    "The respondents were summoned to face trial.",
    "The Trial Magistrate acquitted the respondents, holding that the prosecution was barred by limitation under Section 79 of the Mines Act, 1952.",
    "The State of Bihar appealed to the High Court, which upheld the acquittal.",
    "The State of Bihar then appealed to the Supreme Court of India.",
    "The key legal issue was whether the failure to furnish returns by the specified dates constituted a 'continuing offence', thereby saving the prosecution from the limitation period prescribed in Section 79 of the Mines Act."

The defense argues the 'date of commission' is paramount for defining the nature (non-continuing) of the offence.",

  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Appeal dismissed. Acquittal of respondents upheld.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Supreme Court differentiated between an offence committed 'once and for all' and a 'continuing offence'.",
      "A continuing offence involves a failure to obey a rule that imposes a duty extending from day to day, like maintaining a register or premises in a certain condition.",
      "The Court held that Regulation 19(1)(b) required the submission of returns by specific dates (July 21 and January 21).",
      "The failure to submit the return by the specified date constituted a complete offence on that date (or the day immediately following the deadline).",
      "The regulation did not impose a continuing duty to furnish the return after the deadline had passed.",
      "Therefore, the failure to submit the returns was not a continuing offence.",
      "Consequently, the prosecution initiated on April 12, 1961, was barred by the limitation period prescribed in Section 79 of the Mines Act, 1952, as it was filed more than six months after the commission of the offence (non-submission by the due date).",
      "The Court reasoned that if the non-submission were treated as a continuing offence, the limitation clause in Section 79 would become otiose for such breaches."
