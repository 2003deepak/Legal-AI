  "facts": [
    "The appellant, Shivcharan Lal Verma, was originally tried for an offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).",
    "The trial court convicted the appellant, but the specific section of conviction by the trial court is not detailed in the 2007 Supreme Court judgment.",
    "On appeal, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh altered the conviction from the original charge (presumably Section 302 IPC or similar) to one under Section 304 Part II of the IPC.",
    "The High Court sentenced the appellant to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a term of five years.",
    "The appellant filed an appeal before the Supreme Court of India challenging the High Court's judgment.",
    "During the pendency of the appeal in the Supreme Court, a compromise was reached between the appellant and the legal heirs (specifically the son and widow) of the deceased.",
    "An application was filed in the Supreme Court seeking permission to compound the offence based on this compromise.",
    "The appellant had already undergone a period of imprisonment (approximately four months as noted in the judgment).",
    "The key issue before the Supreme Court in this specific (2007) judgment was the effect of the compromise on the conviction and sentence under Section 304 Part II IPC."
