      "The court prioritized the intention/knowledge element of Section 307 IPC over the actual severity of the injury caused.",
      "The use of a knife (dangerous weapon) to stab the victim in the abdomen (a vital part of the body) was sufficient to infer the requisite intention or knowledge for Section 307 IPC.",
      "The testimony of the injured witness (PW-1) was found reliable and consistent, corroborated by other eyewitnesses (PW-2, PW-3, PW-4) and medical evidence (Ex. P-5, P-6). Minor discrepancies were held to be insignificant.",
      "The court relied on the principle that the testimony of an injured witness is generally considered trustworthy and requires strong reasons for rejection.",
      "Non-examination of independent witnesses was not considered fatal as the evidence of the injured witness and other eyewitnesses was deemed credible and sufficient.",
      "The argument to reduce the conviction to Section 324 IPC was explicitly rejected, emphasizing that the focus of Section 307 is the nature of the act and the accompanying intent/knowledge, not solely the result (gravity of injury).",
      "The court found that the act committed by the appellant fell squarely within the definition of attempt to murder under Section 307 IPC based on the established facts and legal principles regarding intent derived from weapon and location of injury."
