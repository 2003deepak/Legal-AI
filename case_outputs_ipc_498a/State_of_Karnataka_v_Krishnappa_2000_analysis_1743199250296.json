    "reasoning": [
      "Regarding Section 376 IPC (Rape): The Supreme Court acknowledged the brutality of the act but held that based on the explicit statutory language of the Exception to Section 375 IPC (as it stood then), sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, provided she was not under 15 years of age, did not constitute rape, even if forceful and without consent. The Court stated it was bound by the law as written, despite moral reservations.",
      "Regarding Section 302 IPC (Murder): The Court found the circumstantial evidence sufficient to uphold the conviction. The medical evidence clearly established homicide (asphyxia due to smothering/strangulation) and violent sexual activity preceding death (injuries, semen). The 'last seen together' circumstance, coupled with the medical findings indicating extreme violence inconsistent with consensual activity, formed a complete chain pointing exclusively to the guilt of the accused (husband) for murder. The brutality itself indicated the necessary intent for murder.",
      "The court differentiated between the legal definition of rape (which included the marital exception) and the act of murder, finding sufficient evidence for the latter independent of the legal classification of the sexual act."
