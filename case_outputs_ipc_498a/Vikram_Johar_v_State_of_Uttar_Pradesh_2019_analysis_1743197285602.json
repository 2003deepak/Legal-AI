    "The application sought to summon the appellant (Vikram Johar) to face trial for the offence punishable under Section 307 IPC (attempt to murder), based on the allegations in the FIR, the complainant's statement under Section 161 CrPC, and his deposition as PW-1.",
    "The Trial Court allowed the application under Section 319 CrPC and summoned the appellant to face trial under Section 307 IPC.",
