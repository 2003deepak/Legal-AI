    "The accused allegedly inserted his penis into the vagina of the child.",
    "The act caused injuries to the child, specifically a rupture of the hymen resulting in bleeding.",
    "The child cried out, alerting the mother who discovered the bleeding.",
    "Medical examination confirmed the injury to the child's private parts.",

    "The High Court, on appeal, acquitted the respondent of rape under Section 376 but convicted him under Section 354, IPC (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty).",

    "The Supreme Court primarily dealt with the interpretation of 'penetration' under Section 375 and the meaning of 'modesty' under Section 354 in the context of a very young child."

    "reasoning": [
      "Regarding Section 376 (Rape): The Court (Majority: Subba Rao C.J., Shelat J.) found that the evidence regarding penetration was ambiguous. While there was injury, it could not be definitively concluded beyond reasonable doubt that penetration, as required by Section 375, had occurred. Benefit of the doubt was given to the accused on this charge.",
      "Regarding Section 354 (Outraging Modesty - Majority: Subba Rao C.J., Shelat J.): The Court held that 'modesty' is an attribute pertaining to the female sex as a class. It is an objective quality inherent in a woman/female, irrespective of her age or her own understanding of it. A very young female child possesses modesty which can be outraged by an indecent assault. The essence of the offence is the culpable intention of the offender.",
      "Regarding Section 354 (Dissenting Opinion: Bachawat J.): Justice Bachawat dissented on the interpretation of Section 354. He opined that 'modesty' entails a sense of propriety and decency, which a child of tender years cannot possess. Therefore, an essential element of the offence (outraging that specific quality) could not be established when the victim is an infant lacking such awareness.",
      "The Court confirmed that the act committed by the respondent was an assault intended to outrage the modesty of the victim, thus affirming the applicability of Section 354 based on the majority view."
