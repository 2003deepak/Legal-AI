  "facts": [
    "On 03.07.1986, in the afternoon, the deceased, a minor girl aged about 7 years, went out to graze goats in Village Dudu, Rajasthan.",
    "When she did not return by evening, her family and villagers searched for her.",
    "On 04.07.1986, in the morning, her dead body was found near a 'Nala' (drain/stream).",
    "PW-3 (victim's father) lodged an FIR (No. 112/86) at Police Station Dudu.",
    "An inquest report (Ex. P-3) was prepared.",
    "Post-mortem examination was conducted by Dr. R.K. Goyal (PW-1), who found 11 external injuries (including incised wounds, abrasions, contusions) and signs consistent with rape (torn hymen, presence of whitish discharge). Cause of death opined as shock due to multiple injuries, sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, with possible asphyxia (throttling).",
    "PW-2 (Mohan) stated he saw the accused Om Prakash taking the deceased girl towards the 'Nala' between 4-5 PM on 03.07.1986.",
    "Accused Om Prakash was arrested on 07.07.1986.",
    "Pursuant to a disclosure statement made by the accused under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, a 'Kassi' (spade) was recovered from his house.",
    "The Serologist report indicated human blood on the recovered Kassi and the accused's underwear, though the blood group was inconclusive. Semen was detected on vaginal swabs and the victim's 'Ghaghri' (skirt).",
    "The Trial Court (Addl. Sessions Judge, Kishangarh) convicted the accused under Sections 302 and 376 IPC, sentencing him to death for murder and 10 years RI for rape.",
    "The High Court of Rajasthan acquitted the accused, finding PW-2 unreliable, doubting the recovery evidence, and deeming medical evidence insufficient to connect the accused.",
    "The State of Rajasthan filed an appeal against the acquittal in the Supreme Court."
