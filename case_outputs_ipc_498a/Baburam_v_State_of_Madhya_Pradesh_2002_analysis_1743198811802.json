    "Ramvati fell ill on 09.09.1990 and died on 10.09.1990.",

    "Some contradictions noted in PW testimonies regarding the exact duration Ramvati stayed at her parental home before being sent back (PW-1 stated 2 months, PW-3 stated 15 days).",
    "The Trial Court convicted Baburam under Sections 302 and 498A of the Indian Penal Code.",
    "The High Court of Madhya Pradesh acquitted Baburam, disbelieving the testimony of PW-1, PW-2, and PW-3 due to contradictions and their status as interested witnesses.",
