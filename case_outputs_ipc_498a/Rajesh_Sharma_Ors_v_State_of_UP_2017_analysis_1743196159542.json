  "facts": [
    "The case originated from proceedings under Section 498A IPC and potentially other sections, highlighting concerns over the widespread misuse of Section 498A.",
    "The Supreme Court took cognizance of the tendency to implicate the husband and all his relatives, including those living far away, in dowry harassment cases based on omnibus allegations.",
    "The Court referred to previous judicial observations and Law Commission Reports pointing out that Section 498A was increasingly being used as a weapon rather than a shield by disgruntled wives.",
    "Specific factual matrix of the underlying complaint leading to this appeal/petition is not the primary focus; the judgment addresses the general procedure for handling Section 498A complaints.",
    "The Court noted the mandate of Section 41(1)(b) CrPC, as interpreted in Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, requiring police officers to record reasons for arrest and the Magistrate to scrutinize these reasons for offences punishable up to 7 years.",
    "Judicial Observation: Need to balance the statutory object of protecting victims of cruelty with the protection of innocent family members from harassment and automatic arrest.",
    "Judicial Observation: Immediate arrest and detention often lead to irreversible social stigma and difficulties in reconciliation or settlement."
