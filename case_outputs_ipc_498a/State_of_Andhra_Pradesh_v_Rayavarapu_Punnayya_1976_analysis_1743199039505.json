  "facts": [
    "A dispute arose concerning the flow of irrigation water from a channel ('Bodhi').",
    "Accused No. 1 (A-1, Rayavarapu Punnayya) allegedly diverted water, obstructing flow to the fields of Prosecution Witness 1 (PW-1) and the deceased (Jagannadham).",
    "On the morning of July 14, 1968, the deceased questioned A-1 about the obstruction, leading to a verbal altercation.",
    "Subsequently, A-1, along with Accused Nos. 2 to 5 (A-2 to A-5), arrived armed with stout bamboo sticks ('lathis' or 'geddas').",
    "The accused collectively attacked the deceased.",
    "Medical evidence indicated the deceased sustained 19 injuries, including serious head injuries (fractures) inflicted by blunt weapons (consistent with lathis).",
    "The deceased succumbed to his injuries ten days later, on July 24, 1968, in the hospital.",
    "The Trial Court convicted all five accused under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC (Murder committed in furtherance of common intention) and sentenced them to life imprisonment.",
    "The High Court of Andhra Pradesh, on appeal, altered the conviction to Section 304 Part II read with Section 34 IPC (Culpable homicide not amounting to murder, committed with knowledge but without intention, in furtherance of common intention), reducing the sentence to rigorous imprisonment for five years.",
    "The State of Andhra Pradesh appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court's decision, seeking restoration of the Trial Court's conviction under Section 302 IPC."

      "The Supreme Court provided a seminal analysis distinguishing Culpable Homicide (Sec 299) from Murder (Sec 300).",
      "The Court emphasized the application of Section 300 Clause 3rdly: if the prosecution proves that the accused intentionally inflicted a bodily injury, and that injury is objectively sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the offence is murder, irrespective of whether the accused subjectively knew death would likely result.",
      "Applying Virsa Singh, the Court found that the multiple, severe injuries, especially on the head, inflicted with stout lathis demonstrated an intention to cause those specific injuries.",
      "Medical evidence established that these injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",
      "Therefore, the conditions of Section 300 Clause 3rdly were met, making the offence murder.",
      "The High Court erred in reducing the conviction based on the weapon type (lathis can be deadly) or the lack of instantaneous death.",
      "The Court clarified the distinction between Sec 304 Part I (intention to cause death/likely bodily injury, but not meeting Sec 300 criteria) and Part II (knowledge that death is likely, without such intention). Since the act fell under Sec 300 Clause 3rdly, Sec 304 was inapplicable.",
      "The collective action of the accused established common intention under Section 34 for the commission of the act defined as murder."
