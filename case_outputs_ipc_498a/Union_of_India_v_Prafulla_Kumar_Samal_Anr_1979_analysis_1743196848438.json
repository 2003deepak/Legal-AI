  "facts": [
    "Respondent No. 1, Prafulla Kumar Samal, served as an Executive Engineer in the Public Works Department, Government of Orissa.",
    "The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) investigated allegations that Respondent No. 1 possessed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income during the period 13 May 1961 to 30 April 1972.",
    "A chargesheet was filed against Respondent No. 1 under Section 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.",
    "Respondent No. 2, Smt. Pravatnalini Mohanty (sister of Respondent No. 1's wife), was charged under Section 109 IPC for abetting the offence committed by Respondent No. 1.",
    "The prosecution alleged that Respondent No. 1's assets were disproportionate by Rs. 1,44,138.44.",
    "The case was heard by the Special Judge, Bhubaneswar, who considered the material presented by the prosecution and the explanations offered by the defence at the stage of framing charges (under Sections 227/228 CrPC, 1973).",
    "The Special Judge, by order dated 31 August 1976, found that the prosecution failed to make out a prima facie case and discharged both respondents under Section 227 CrPC.",
    "The Special Judge considered explanations for assets, including income from Respondent No. 1's wife, agricultural income, loans taken, and gifts received, finding them plausible enough to negate the allegation of disproportionate assets prima facie.",
    "The Union of India filed a criminal revision petition before the High Court of Orissa.",
    "The High Court of Orissa, by order dated 4 January 1977, dismissed the revision petition and upheld the Special Judge's order of discharge.",
    "The Union of India appealed to the Supreme Court by special leave."
