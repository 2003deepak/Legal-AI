  "facts": [
    "The petitioner, Sushil Kumar Sharma, filed a Writ Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.",
    "The petition challenged the constitutional validity of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.",
    "The primary grounds for the challenge were that Section 498A violated Articles 14 (Equality before law) and 21 (Protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.",
    "The petitioner argued that the section was vague, overly broad, conferred arbitrary power on police and courts, and was being widely misused by disgruntled wives and their families to harass husbands and their relatives.",
    "The petitioner contended that the term 'cruelty' as defined in the explanation to Section 498A was ambiguous and susceptible to subjective interpretation.",
    "It was argued that the provision led to automatic arrest of the husband and his relatives upon lodging of a complaint, often without adequate investigation, causing immense social stigma and hardship.",
    "The petitioner highlighted instances where the provision was allegedly used as a tool for blackmail and extortion.",
    "The Union of India (Respondent) defended the constitutionality of the provision, emphasizing its objective to protect women from cruelty and harassment related to dowry demands within the matrimonial home."

  "ipc_sections": [
    "Section 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty)",
    "Note: While the petition arose likely from a specific case involving S.498A against the petitioner, the judgment primarily deals with the constitutional challenge to the section itself, not the factual merits of an underlying criminal case. Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India are central to the legal analysis."

  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Writ Petition Dismissed. Section 498A IPC held to be constitutionally valid.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Supreme Court acknowledged the societal menace of dowry deaths and cruelty towards married women, which Section 498A aims to combat.",
      "The Court upheld the presumption of constitutionality attached to the legislation.",
      "It held that the classification under Section 498A (husband and his relatives) is not arbitrary or unreasonable, given the context of marital relationships and the prevalence of such cruelty within them. It satisfies the test of intelligible differentia having a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.",
      "The Court rejected the argument that the term 'cruelty' is vague, stating that it has been clearly defined in the explanation to the section, covering both mental and physical cruelty related to unlawful demands or conduct likely to drive the woman to suicide.",
      "While acknowledging that the provision might be misused by some, the Court firmly stated that the mere possibility of misuse cannot be a ground for declaring a statutory provision unconstitutional.",
      "The Court emphasized that the remedy for misuse lies in diligent investigation by police, cautious application by courts, and potentially utilizing provisions like Section 182 IPC (False information) or initiating defamation proceedings against false accusers.",
      "The Court observed that safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention are available under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the principles laid down in cases like D.K. Basu.",
      "The legislative object of protecting women outweighs the concerns about potential misuse, which needs to be addressed through careful implementation rather than striking down the law itself."
