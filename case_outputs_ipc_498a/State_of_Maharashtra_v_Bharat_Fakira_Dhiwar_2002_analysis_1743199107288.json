    "Prosecution alleged that the accused came home drunk and demanded Rs. 10/- from his wife, Kamalabai, to purchase more liquor.",
    "When Kamalabai refused, stating there was no money, the accused allegedly became enraged, poured kerosene from a nearby tin onto her, and set her ablaze with a matchstick.",
    "Kamalabai ran out of the hut screaming, engulfed in flames.",
    "Neighbours, including PW2 Tarabai, PW3 Hausabai, and PW4 Sundarabai, rushed to the spot upon hearing her screams, extinguished the fire, and covered her with a quilt.",
    "Kamalabai was taken to the Rural Hospital, Kopargaon, by PW5 Sampat (brother-in-law of the accused).",
    "A dying declaration (DD1 - Exhibit 28) was recorded by the Special Judicial Magistrate (SJM), PW7 Mr. Bora, at around 10:30 PM on 11.05.1991, after PW1 Dr. Ashok Kumar certified her fit to make a statement. In this declaration, Kamalabai implicated the accused.",
