  "facts": [
    "The Stree Atyachar Virodhi Parishad (Appellant), a registered public society dedicated to assisting women subjected to atrocities, filed a criminal complaint.",
    "The complaint was filed before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Pune, against Dilip Nathumal Chordiya (Respondent No. 1), his parents (Respondents Nos. 2 & 3), his married sister (Respondent No. 4), and his distant relatives (uncle and cousins - Respondents Nos. 5, 6, & 7).",
    "The complaint alleged that Chanda, wife of Dilip Chordiya, was subjected to physical and mental torture by the respondents due to dissatisfaction with dowry.",
    "Specific allegations included demands for Rs. 50,000, beatings, starvation, and threats, leading Chanda to leave the matrimonial home and stay with her parents.",
    "The Magistrate took cognizance of the complaint and issued process against all accused under Section 498A IPC.",
    "The Respondents filed an application under Section 482 CrPC before the Bombay High Court seeking to quash the proceedings.",
    "The High Court quashed the proceedings on two main grounds: (i) The Appellant Parishad, being a third party, had no *locus standi* to file the complaint under Section 498A IPC, as Section 198A CrPC specifies who can complain for this offense. (ii) The allegations against the distant relatives (Respondents 4-7) were vague and did not constitute an offense under Section 498A IPC, as they were not 'relatives' within the meaning intended by the section.",
    "The Stree Atyachar Virodhi Parishad appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court.",
    "The victim, Chanda, also filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court supporting the Parishad's complaint and confirming the allegations.",
    "The State of Maharashtra supported the Appellant Parishad's stance."
