      "It was observed that Section 498A is a shield, not a weapon, and its object is to prevent harassment for dowry, not to enable disgruntled wives to harass distant relatives.",
      "Continuing the prosecution against the appellants based on such non-specific allegations would amount to an abuse of the process of law.",
      "The High Court failed to properly exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC by dismissing the appellants' petition despite the lack of specific allegations against them.",
      "The Court emphasized the need for Courts to be cautious in dealing with such complaints and scrutinize the allegations carefully before summoning distant relatives.",
      "The Court suggested exploring measures like preliminary inquiries before registering FIRs involving distant relatives or considering mediation/conciliation."
