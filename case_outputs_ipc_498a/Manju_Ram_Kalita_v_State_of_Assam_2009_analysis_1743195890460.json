    "outcome": "Conviction altered from Section 307 IPC to Section 324 IPC. Sentence reduced to the period already undergone (which was approximately 3 months).",

      "The Supreme Court emphasized that the core difference between Sections 307 and 324/326 lies in the 'intention or knowledge' of the accused.",
      "To sustain a conviction under Section 307, the prosecution must prove that the act was done with the intention or knowledge that it would cause death.",
      "Factors like the nature of the weapon, the manner of its use, the part of the body targeted, and the severity of the injury are relevant but not conclusive.",
      "The Court analyzed precedents distinguishing these sections, highlighting that causing a grievous injury, even with a dangerous weapon, does not automatically equate to an attempt to murder.",
      "In this case, while a dangerous weapon was used and a grievous injury was inflicted on a vital area (abdomen), the fact that it was a single blow was considered significant.",
      "The Court concluded that the prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt the requisite intention or knowledge to cause death under Section 307.",
      "However, the act clearly constituted voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon, falling squarely under Section 324 IPC.",
      "Considering the appellant had already served about 3 months and the incident occurred long ago (1999), the sentence was reduced to the period already undergone."
