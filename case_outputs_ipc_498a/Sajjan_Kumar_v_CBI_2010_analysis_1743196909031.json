  "facts": [
    "The case originates from the anti-Sikh riots in Delhi following the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 31.10.1984.",
    "Specifically relates to incidents of violence, arson, and murder in the Sultanpuri area of Delhi between 01.11.1984 and 04.11.1984.",
    "FIR No. 416/1984 was registered at P.S. Sultanpuri regarding the killing of Surjit Singh, husband of complainant/witness Jagdish Kaur.",
    "Initial investigations by Delhi Police did not name Sajjan Kumar; charge sheets were filed against other individuals who were eventually acquitted.",
    "Several commissions and committees (Marwah, Misra, Kapur-Mittal, Jain-Aggarwal, Nanavati) investigated the riots over the years.",
    "The Justice Nanavati Commission of Inquiry, in its report submitted in 2005, found credible evidence against Sajjan Kumar and others, recommending legal action.",
    "Based on the Nanavati Commission report, the Government directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct further investigation.",
    "CBI recorded statements of witnesses, including Jagdish Kaur, Nirpreet Kaur, and Jagsher Singh, who implicated Sajjan Kumar in instigating and participating in the mob violence.",
    "CBI filed charge sheets against Sajjan Kumar and others for various offences related to the riots in the Sultanpuri area.",
    "The Trial Court (Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi), after considering the materials submitted by the CBI, ordered framing of charges against Sajjan Kumar and co-accused under multiple IPC sections on 17.12.2009.",
    "Sajjan Kumar challenged the Trial Court's order before the Delhi High Court.",
    "The Delhi High Court dismissed Sajjan Kumar's petition and upheld the Trial Court's order framing charges on 19.07.2010.",
    "Sajjan Kumar appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court of India.",
    "The core issue before the Supreme Court was whether a prima facie case and 'grave suspicion' existed based on the materials on record to justify the framing of charges under Sections 227/228 CrPC."
