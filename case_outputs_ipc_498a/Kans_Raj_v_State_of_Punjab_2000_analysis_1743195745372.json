      "The evidence indicated persistent harassment for dowry (scooter), satisfying the requirement of cruelty 'soon before death' under Section 304B, thereby invoking the presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act.",
      "The Court emphasized the distinction between Section 304B and Section 306 IPC. While cruelty was proven, which is common to both Section 498A and potentially 304B, it did not automatically satisfy the requirements for abetment under Section 306.",
      "To sustain a conviction under Section 306, positive proof of action proximate to the time of occurrence, involving instigation, conspiracy, or intentional aiding for suicide, is necessary. This was found lacking.",
      "The Court held that convicting under both Sections 304B and 306 for the same set of facts was inappropriate, as Section 304B is a distinct offence relating to dowry death with a specific statutory presumption, whereas Section 306 requires proof of active abetment.",
      "Since the ingredients for dowry death (Section 304B) were established, triggering the presumption under Section 113B, this conviction was sustained. However, the evidence did not independently establish the elements required for abetment of suicide under Section 306 beyond reasonable doubt."
