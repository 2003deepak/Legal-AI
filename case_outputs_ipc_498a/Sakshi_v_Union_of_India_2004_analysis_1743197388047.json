  "facts": [
    "Sakshi, a non-governmental organization (NGO), along with other petitioners, filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) under Article 32 of the Constitution of India before the Supreme Court.",
    "The PIL highlighted the inadequacy of the definition of 'rape' under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, particularly concerning child sexual abuse.",
    "Petitioners argued that the existing definition, primarily focused on penile-vaginal penetration ('sexual intercourse'), failed to encompass other prevalent forms of penetrative sexual assault against children, such as penile-oral penetration, penile-anal penetration, and penetration by objects.",
    "They contended that these acts, while severely violating a child's dignity and physical integrity, were often prosecuted under lesser offenses like Section 354 (outraging modesty) or Section 377 (unnatural offences - which had its own issues regarding consent and applicability), carrying significantly lower punishments than rape (Section 376).",
    "The petitioners sought a broader judicial interpretation of 'penetration' within Section 375 or directions to the legislature to amend the law.",
    "Reference was made to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ratified by India in 1992, obligating the state to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse.",
    "The Law Commission of India's 172nd Report, which recommended amendments to rape laws including broadening the definition of sexual assault, was also brought to the Court's attention."

  "prosecution_arguments": [
    {
      "argument": "The definition of 'rape' under Section 375 IPC, requiring 'sexual intercourse' interpreted traditionally as penile-vaginal penetration, is excessively narrow and fails to protect children from heinous forms of penetrative sexual assault like oral, anal, or object penetration.",

  "judgment": {
    "outcome": "Petition partly allowed. The Supreme Court acknowledged the lacuna in the law and the inadequacy of Section 375 IPC to cover all forms of child sexual assault. However, the Court declined to judicially rewrite the definition of 'rape'. Instead, it strongly recommended that Parliament amend the law to broaden the definition of sexual assault to include all forms of penetration (oral, anal, object) against children, aligning it with constitutional principles and international obligations (CRC). The court interpreted 'penetration' within the existing Section 375 to mean 'penetration to any extent', but recognized this did not resolve the issue of non-vaginal penetration.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Court recognized the fundamental rights of children under Articles 14, 15(3), and 21 of the Constitution.",
      "It acknowledged India's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).",
      "The Court accepted the petitioners' argument that Section 375, as traditionally interpreted, was under-inclusive and failed to protect children adequately.",
      "It noted the recommendations of the Law Commission of India (172nd Report).",
      "The Court affirmed the principle of separation of powers, stating that defining crimes is primarily a legislative function and judicial intervention by rewriting the statute should be avoided.",
      "While declining to redefine 'rape', the Court used its constitutional authority to strongly urge Parliament to rectify the legislative gap by amending the IPC or enacting specific legislation.",
      "The judgment effectively paved the way for future legislative reforms, culminating in the POCSO Act, 2012 and amendments to the IPC."
