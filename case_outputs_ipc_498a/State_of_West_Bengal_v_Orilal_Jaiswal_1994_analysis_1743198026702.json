    "The deceased, Soma Rani Jaiswal, was married to Nimai Charan Jaiswal (Accused No. 2).",
    "Orilal Jaiswal (Accused No. 1) was the father-in-law, and Kanan Bala Jaiswal (Accused No. 3) was the mother-in-law of the deceased.",
    "On June 16, 1984, Soma Rani died due to extensive burn injuries sustained in her matrimonial home.",
    "The prosecution alleged that the deceased committed suicide due to continuous torture, harassment, and cruelty inflicted by all three accused.",
    "Evidence presented included an alleged dying declaration made by Soma Rani to her father (PW1) and uncle (PW2) implicating the accused.",
    "Letters written by the deceased to her family, allegedly indicating her suffering and harassment, were also part of the evidence.",
    "Testimony from neighbours (PW3, PW4) regarding quarrels and the deceased appearing unhappy was recorded.",
    "Medical evidence confirmed death due to shock and hemorrhage resulting from extensive (90-100%) ante-mortem burns.",
    "The Trial Court (Additional Sessions Judge, Alipore) acquitted all three accused, finding the evidence insufficient to prove abetment of suicide under Section 306 IPC beyond reasonable doubt. The court doubted the authenticity and reliability of the dying declaration and the interpretation of the letters.",
    "The State of West Bengal appealed the acquittal to the Calcutta High Court.",
    "The High Court reversed the Trial Court's judgment, convicted all three accused under Section 306 read with Section 34 IPC, and sentenced each to five years' rigorous imprisonment.",
    "The High Court primarily relied on the dying declaration and the letters as proof of cruelty leading to suicide.",
    "The accused (Orilal Jaiswal and others) filed an appeal against the High Court's conviction in the Supreme Court."

      "The evidence presented (including the dying declaration and letters) might indicate cruelty or harassment causing mental distress, but it fell short of proving instigation or aiding/abetting the suicide.",
      "The Court emphasized the distinction between the concepts of 'abetment of suicide' under Section 306 and 'cruelty' under Section 498A IPC (though 498A was not directly in issue). Actions constituting cruelty might not necessarily amount to abetment.",
      "The High Court erred in interfering with the Trial Court's acquittal. The Trial Court's view on the evidence was plausible and could not be termed perverse or wholly unreasonable. Reversing an acquittal requires stronger grounds than simply holding a different opinion.",
