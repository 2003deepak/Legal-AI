  "facts": [
    "Tapati Bag (Wife/Complainant) filed a criminal complaint against her husband, Patipaban Ghosh (Accused/Petitioner), and potentially other relatives.",
    "The complaint alleged offences primarily related to matrimonial cruelty and misappropriation of property.",
    "Specific allegations likely included demands for dowry, physical and mental torture constituting cruelty under Section 498A IPC.",
    "Allegations also included entrustment of 'stridhan' (dowry articles and personal property of the wife) to the husband and/or his family, and their subsequent refusal to return these items upon demand, constituting criminal breach of trust under Section 406 IPC.",
    "The complaint was likely filed before a Magistrate, who may have taken cognizance and issued process.",
    "Patipaban Ghosh (and potentially others accused) filed a petition before the Calcutta High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) seeking to quash the criminal proceedings initiated against them.",
    "The High Court petition likely argued that the complaint did not disclose a prima facie case, was motivated by malice, constituted an abuse of the process of court, or that the dispute was essentially civil in nature.",
    "This case represents the judgment of the Calcutta High Court on the petition to quash the proceedings."
