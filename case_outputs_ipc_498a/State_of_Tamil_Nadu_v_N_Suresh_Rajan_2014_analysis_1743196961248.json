  "facts": [
    "N. Suresh Rajan (Respondent No. 1/Accused No. 1 - A1) was a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of Tamil Nadu from 13.05.1996 to 13.05.2001.",
    "During this period, he also served as the Minister for Khadi, Animal Husbandry, Milk and Dairy Development Corporation.",
    "The Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC), Nagercoil Detachment, registered an FIR (RC No. 5 of 2002) against A1 and others under Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PC Act) and Section 109 IPC.",
    "The allegation was that A1, during the check period (13.05.1996 to 13.05.2001), acquired assets disproportionate to his known sources of income in his name and the names of his relatives (Accused Nos. 2 to 7 - A2 to A7).",
    "The charge sheet was filed on 15.05.2006 before the Special Judge/Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tirunelveli.",
    "A1 filed a discharge petition (Crl. M.P. No. 1910 of 2006) primarily arguing that: (a) An MLA is not a 'public servant' under Section 2(c) of the PC Act, (b) No valid sanction under Section 19 of the PC Act was obtained for his prosecution.",
    "The Special Judge dismissed the discharge petition on 06.01.2007, holding that an MLA is a public servant and sanction was not required as A1 had ceased to be an MLA/Minister when cognizance was taken.",
    "A1 filed a Criminal Revision Petition (Crl. R.C. No. 216 of 2007) before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court.",
    "The High Court, by its order dated 30.04.2012, allowed the revision petition and discharged A1, holding that an MLA is a public servant, but sanction under Section 19 PC Act was necessary even if the accused ceased to hold office, relying on *R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay* (1984) and distinguishing *Prakash Singh Badal v. State of Punjab* (2007).",
    "The State of Tamil Nadu appealed the High Court's order to the Supreme Court.",
    "Respondents 2-7 (A2-A7) were relatives of A1, accused of abetting the offence under Section 109 IPC read with PC Act sections."

      "The primary issue decided was the requirement of sanction under Section 19 PC Act. The Court analyzed the language 'is employed' in Section 19(1) and contrasted it with the language 'was employed' used elsewhere.",
      "The Court followed the precedent set in *Prakash Singh Badal v. State of Punjab (2007)* and *Abhay Singh Chautala v. CBI (2011)*, holding that sanction under Section 19 PC Act is not required if the public servant has ceased to hold the office (demitted office) which he is alleged to have abused, at the time of taking cognizance of the offence.",
      "The Court explicitly distinguished the observations in *R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay (1984)*, stating that the relevant observations were made in the context of the PC Act, 1947, and the specific wording of Section 19 of the PC Act, 1988, mandates focusing on the status of the accused at the time of cognizance.",
      "Since N. Suresh Rajan was not an MLA or Minister when cognizance was taken by the Special Court in 2006, no sanction was required for his prosecution.",
      "The High Court erred in relying on *R.S. Nayak* and ignoring the later, more direct precedents like *Prakash Singh Badal* concerning the interpretation of Section 19 of the PC Act, 1988.",
      "The dismissal of the discharge petition by the Trial Court was correct in law."
