  "facts": [
    "Reema Aggarwal (Appellant) married Anupam (Respondent No. 1) on June 27, 1996, according to Hindu rites.",
    "Prior to this marriage, Anupam was already married to Roopa, and this first marriage was subsisting.",
    "Reema alleged that she was unaware of Anupam's first marriage at the time of her marriage.",
    "Reema alleged that soon after the marriage, she was subjected to physical and mental torture, harassment, and cruelty by Anupam and his relatives (Respondents No. 2 to 5) over demands for dowry.",
    "Reema filed a complaint alleging offenses under Sections 498A, 323, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).",
    "The Respondents filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) before the High Court seeking quashing of the FIR and consequent proceedings.",
    "The High Court quashed the proceedings, primarily on the ground that the marriage between Reema and Anupam was null and void due to Anupam's existing first marriage, and therefore, Anupam could not be considered Reema's 'husband' within the meaning of Section 498A IPC.",
    "Reema Aggarwal appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court of India."

      "The Supreme Court adopted a purposive interpretation of Section 498A, emphasizing its object to protect women from cruelty occurring within a domestic relationship resembling marriage.",
      "It held that a person who enters into a marital arrangement and holds himself out to society as a husband cannot be allowed to take shelter behind the legality of the marriage (or lack thereof) to escape liability under Section 498A, especially when the invalidity arises from his own prior subsisting marriage.",
      "To deny the applicability of Section 498A would be to reward the accused for his own wrongdoing (bigamy).",
      "The Court distinguished the object and scope of Section 498A IPC from Section 125 CrPC (maintenance). While maintenance requires a legally valid 'wife', Section 498A addresses cruelty within a relationship having the *semblance* of marriage.",
      "The definition of 'cruelty' in Section 498A is specifically tailored and broader than concepts under matrimonial laws.",
