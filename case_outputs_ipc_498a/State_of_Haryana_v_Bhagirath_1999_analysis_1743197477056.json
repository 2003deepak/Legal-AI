    "Raj Bala (deceased) married Bhagirath (Respondent 1/Accused 1) on May 19, 1988.",
    "Manphool (Respondent 2/Accused 2) is the father-in-law, and Anguri (Respondent 3/Accused 3) is the mother-in-law of the deceased.",
    "Allegations surfaced soon after marriage regarding demands for dowry (scooter, television) by the accused.",
    "The deceased allegedly faced harassment and cruelty due to non-fulfillment of these demands.",
    "A 'panchayat' was reportedly convened sometime before the incident to address the dowry demands, but the date is not specified.",
    "The deceased, Raj Bala, died due to burn injuries sustained at her matrimonial home on June 10, 1990 (within 7 years of marriage).",
    "The father of the deceased (PW-3 Dharam Singh) lodged the First Information Report (FIR), alleging dowry harassment leading to death.",
    "The defense claimed the death was accidental, occurring while the deceased was preparing tea on a stove.",
    "The Trial Court acquitted all three accused, disbelieving the prosecution witnesses regarding dowry demands and cruelty, and finding the defense version of an accidental fire plausible.",
    "The State of Haryana appealed the acquittal to the High Court.",
    "The High Court reversed the Trial Court's judgment, convicted all three accused under Section 304B IPC, and sentenced them to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment. The High Court believed the prosecution witnesses, found the defense version unreliable, and invoked the presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act.",

    "outcome": "Appeal allowed. The Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the High Court convicting the accused under Section 304B IPC and restored the Trial Court's judgment of acquittal.",
    "reasoning": [
      "The Supreme Court analyzed the meaning of 'soon before her death' under Section 304B IPC and Section 113B of the Evidence Act.",
      "It held that 'soon before' does not mean 'immediately before' but requires a proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the death.",
      "General allegations of torture and harassment over the entire duration of marriage are insufficient; specific instances proving proximate cruelty are necessary.",
      "In this case, the evidence presented by the prosecution (testimony of PW-3 and PW-4) related to demands and a panchayat held much earlier, failing to establish any specific instance of cruelty or harassment proximate to the date of death (June 10, 1990).",
      "The Court found no evidence demonstrating that the dowry demand was persistent and continued until the death, or was intensified shortly before it.",
      "Since the prosecution failed to establish the foundational fact of cruelty 'soon before death', the presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act could not be invoked.",
      "The High Court had erred in reversing the acquittal without adequately addressing the lack of proximate link identified by the Trial Court and without providing compelling reasons to overturn the Trial Court's assessment of evidence.",
      "The Trial Court's view that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, especially regarding the crucial element of 'soon before death', was considered a plausible view."
