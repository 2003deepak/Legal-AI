    "The accused appealed the conviction to the Supreme Court.",

      "Admissibility of evidence must be determined by the law in force at the time the evidence is sought to be led in court. For an IPC trial after TADA's repeal, the governing law is the Indian Evidence Act.",
      "Under Sections 25 and 26 of the Evidence Act, confessions made to police officers (even of SP rank) are inadmissible.",
      "While Section 27 of the Evidence Act remains applicable for discoveries made pursuant to information from the accused, the confession *itself* recorded under TADA Section 15 cannot be admitted.",
