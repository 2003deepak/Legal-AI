  "facts": [
    "The appellant, Ratilal Bhanji Muthani, was apprehended by Customs Officers near Bassein Creek.",
    "Upon searching the appellant, a specially tailored jacket containing 25 slabs of gold was found concealed underneath his regular clothes.",
    "The gold weighed approximately 2497.900 grams.",
    "The gold was seized under a panchnama.",
    "The appellant was charged with offences under the Defence of India Rules, 1971 (DIR) and the Customs Act, 1962.",
    "Specifically, charges were framed under Rule 126-H(2)(d) read with Rule 126-P(2)(ii) of the DIR and Section 135(1)(a) of the Customs Act, 1962.",
    "The Trial Court convicted the appellant under both statutory provisions.",
    "The High Court of Bombay upheld the conviction on appeal.",
    "The appellant subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court, primarily challenging the conviction on the ground that the prosecution failed to prove 'mens rea' (guilty knowledge) beyond reasonable doubt.",
